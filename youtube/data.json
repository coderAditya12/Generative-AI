      "$2.5 billion. That's how much NHN isworth of. After the AI evaluation, ourlife has [music] completely changed. Alot of our daily works right now hascompletely replaced by AI automation andit's getting more popular day by day. AIautomations are making our life fareasier than we ever imagined. And todayin this video, we're going to create ourown AI automation sets from scratch byusing Nex.js. At the end of this videoseries, you will have your own AIautomation set ready. So, I'm superexcited to start this project series.Don't waste any time. Let's see a quickshort demo of what we're going to buildfrom today.All right. Right now we are watching ourflow x website landing page and our thisproject name is flow x and you arewatching here that automate everythingsmarter. We're mentioning it on our heropart meanings we're actually making anautomation s here. So flow x is the nextgeneration open s to build and runworkflows with a superpowers connect anyservice automate any process. We can hitthis",
      "meanings we're actually making anautomation s here. So flow x is the nextgeneration open s to build and runworkflows with a superpowers connect anyservice automate any process. We can hitthis get started free. Then it willactually open this authentication modelwhich I will show you after some time.After that here is on like sectionswhich is explaining how it's actuallyworks. So at first it's going to triggeron like endpoint I mean it's going totrigger on nodes then you have to buildon workflow you have to you can run andmonitor it and you can scale andoptimize it. Yeah. and everything youneed to automate. It's just like somedesigning thing and payment gateway. Wehave uh normal card payment and we havealso cryptocurrency payment. For thefirst time on Body channel, we'reimplementing cryptocurrency payment withthis cryptomas payment gateway so thatyou can receive cryptocurrency paymentinside your any SAS or inside yourapplication as like stripe and thenstart from templates. We have so",
      "payment withthis cryptomas payment gateway so thatyou can receive cryptocurrency paymentinside your any SAS or inside yourapplication as like stripe and thenstart from templates. We have so manyreadym made templates. Uh this is by theway not any true number. We don't have200 plus more templates. No it's justunlike static number. We do haveactually uh four or five templates. Ithink I will show you that after sometime. We have here three uh pricingplan. First one is free where you willbe able to run uh actually 1,000workflow. It's a mistake. It should be1,000 not 100. and five activeworkflows. And with pro, you'll be ableto run $10,000, not 5,000. And thepricing will be $19.99.I forgot to change it, I guess, sinceit's static right now. And it's uh thelanding page. That's why it just somelike minor mistakes since it's the firstpart. That's why you're watching someminor mistakes like some static valueswhich we should change before deployingit. And you can see we haven't deployedyet. It's",

It's still on local host. That'swhy. after this on just like onmarketing line and then on our footerand that's it. We should not waste timeon landing page. That's why I just triedmy best to keep it as small and as asmodern as possible. Then we can hit thisget started free and we have sign inregister and forgot password. And forauthentication we're using here better owhich is on very popular framework rightnow for authentication and better oreally works very well. So yeah now inthis register part let's do register.I'm writing my name, first name, lastname, email we can say supportme.com.Let's write here on passwordsomething like this.Then we can accept the terms andcondition. We canhit this createaccount button and check your email foractivating your account. You'll see anemail here right now.",

For the first part,we're going to make this templates todynamic. And billing. Yeah, it's we'realso going to make it. So here you cansee it's right now free current plan.This is free and this is the pro plan.And let me show you the most interestingthing that the templates.

We can add heredifferent nodes if we want but for nowAI generate is fine since this is forthis templates is for summarizing onemail. So we can say uh we can add hereon prompt. This is definitely optionalbut it's recommended. So we can saysummarize the email and we can hit saveconfiguration. Now we have to connectour open AI model. So we need our openAI API key in here. So we can connectOpenAI or either Gemini or like you knowyou can also connect the clot or anyothernot any other for now only open AI clotand Gemini and I'm hitting this saveconfiguration with my openi API keys.Yeah.So, OpenAI model setup done.

Since we are right now in localhost 3000, I can definitely connectDiscord, but it's not going to work.Why? Because Discord doesn't work withlocal host. Gmail work with local host,but Discord doesn't work like that.That's why we cannot set up Discordright now. After deploying definitelydiscord is also going to work becausewe're going to connect all of these oathproviders in today's video and you willbe able to see how you can connect allof these and it's going to actually workbut since we're still in developmentmode still we are in local that's whyfor now it's not going to work exceptthis Gmail and Google sheets. Yeah. Soinstead of that we can add here an HTTPrequest and we can actuallyconnect it. Yeah. So step three and stepfour you can notice one thing when I'mdeleting something I'm adding",

Let me show you the emailat first then you will understand. It'sdefinitely summarizing the unreademails. Okay. Not all the emails. whenany email status is unread then it'ssummarizing that. So let me show youthis is ouremail uh unfunny thing that it'sactually summarized this security alertbecause I did log in from an incognitomode that's why you can see it's veryfunny this is the summarizer the emailis a security alert uh notifying therecipient about a new sign in to theirGoogle account so it providesinstructions on what to do if the signwas sign in was uh not authorized.

Yeah. So, letme send it again.Uh, I just want to forward on email. Ireceived I have received it from bold.So, I just want to forward it. Yeah,perfect. Now, if we again test thisworkflow, this time you will seedifferent result.So, let's come back here.This time you can see it's sayinguh this is the email subject. This isthe from this is the snippet.

So it's just like giving usan proper summarizeand who giving it open AI is doing itsince here we connected open AIproperly. So that's it. This was just anexample of one template. We're going toactually check all the templates one byone. And in the first part we're notsaving this workflow. We're going to doit at the last part of this videoseries. Means the next part because inthis series we'll have two videos. Thisone and the next one will be the lastone. So that's it. Uh this is what we'regoing to do today. We're going to do alot of work.

I don'twant to extend this demo part to morelong right now. Don't wasteing time.Let's start the coding part. All right,let's start by creating a new folderhere by giving name flow X and Ymeanings YouTube and let's open itinside our Visual Studio Codeandlet's hide the right sidebar. Let's openour terminal and write this that npxcreatenext app and add it latest.What is your project named? We can giveit flow x and hyphen y. Would you liketo use typescript? Yes, we want to usetypescript. Which llinter would you liketo use? We don't want to use anyllinter. So tell me css. Yes. Sourcedirectory. Yes. Approer. Yes.

Turbo packno custom alias no um that by defaultalias is good enough for us right nowit's installing the dependencies andalso installing the dev dependenciesdefinitely it will take some time youcan see our project everything is hereright now we can come back to this pagetsx we can delete everything and we canwrite this rafceif it's not working for you be make surethat you have installed this ES7uh ES7 plus extension.You can see ES7 uh React Redux and ReactNative snippets. Then this AFCE willactually work for you. Yeah. So ourproject setup is done. Right now weactually need one more thing and that ischat CNU. So let me go to our browserand I'm using Google Chrome. So let's goto chat CN. Let's hit get started.Select NextJSand actually copy this comment. Now openour terminal again.

And right now it's updating ourCSS variables. And here you go.Everything done right now.Which components do we need for our thisproject? I don't have any particularlist for this project. So I would preferto install all the components since it'sgoing to stay in our local code. So it'sfine to install all the component. Whatyou have to do? You have to just writethis that npx chat cn added at latestadd and space hyphen and all. Yeah. Thenit's going to install all the libraries.Sorry, not libraries actuallycomponents.

Definitely it will take sometime since it's actually installing thedependencies which we need to run thosecomponents. Yeah, that's what it's rightnow installing.So yeah, installing done. Right now it'supdating the files and here you go.Updating files always comes very fast.You can see the UI folder is here withall the shen UI components. Yeah,perfect. We can clear our terminal rightnow. And we can actually start ourproject by writing npm uh not startsorry npm run div.Perfect. Now let's come back here. Let'sgo to localhost 3000.And here you go.

I am justdoing slow so that you can read itperfectly because as I said earlier thefront- end development knowledge isprerequisite for this full course. Ifyou don't have the web design knowledgeand you should not make application likethis because this is on full stackapplication. It has so many complexthings. So this class name values if youdon't know how to write that it's notactually perfect content for you shouldlearn web design first. All right.

We can save it right now. Andhere you go. You can notice thedifference. I'm again commenting thisline. Then see this is the image. I'magain uncommenting. This is the imagequality right now. So we are just addinghere on overlay like on shadow so thatwe can add here like our hero text andeverything. Yeah. And this backgroundpicture will stay similar here with anbetter view.

It's very simple class names.Yeah, even I also didn't write it bymyself. In this time, no one shouldwrite like web design code by yourself.If you know web design, then you canwrite it easily by using AI. If youdon't know, then don't do it.

The UI looks I think average.I'm not saying it's very beautiful, butyeah, it's better. I mean, it's anaverage UI right now. We can just alsochange the templates background color tolike little bit glossy. Then it willlook more beautiful. But yeah, fine. Fornow it's fine. We have to do so manything after this. Now uh after this twodiv herewe can add on bottom gradient fit. Veryvery important.Something like this. You can see we'rejust using this gradient color. We cansave it. It's actually oneshadow. Okay.

And finally we need onconnection line. So after this div hereactuallynot here after this div. Yeah let's[snorts] add the connection line. Soindex if the step.length minus one thenjust add this connection line. What willhappen? This will add on connection linelike this except the last one. That'show we added this logic here.You can just read the class names. Itseems very easy. Yeah,that's it. Our break is actually donehere.Looks good. It's It looks really verybeautiful how it works.

Let's create a newfolder by giving them featuresand let's add an index.tsx tsxand features sectionwe can save it from the feature sectionfile and we can import it here. Yeah. Souh the same thing we have to again dohere we have to add that section withthat id features and class name againsame class name we are adding for allthe sections. So after this we can addon div and this one also similar thatcontainer and uh maximum width 7 xl andmx auto. After this,let's add on div with class name likethis and H2 that everything you need toautomateand on paragraph that powerful featuresdesigned for developers and teams whowant to build sophisticated automationsworkflows.Yeah.So something like this",

So features on iconlike brain on title that AI notes somedescriptionsI will try my best to add it in thelist.

You can see I am importingactivity from react but we have toimport activity from lucid react notreact. Yeah right now notice there is noerror and everything looks perfect. Solet's save it. Let's come back here. Andhere you go. You can see it's lookingreally very beautiful.So after thisafter this feature description afterthis card uh actually after this div wecan add ouruh sponsor badge orwe can actually like uh delete it oractually it's it is just for marketingpurpose.

And from here you canjust check the other DIV one by one justlike template title, templatedescription and everything here. Soagain it looking very beautiful startfrom templates like just few templates.Now after this still we need to do somemore work. After this divlet's add another div with class nameflex flex wrap and gap 2 and MB4. Nowhere we have to do on loop for ourtemplate tax.

So we justneed an icon here that arrow right withthese class names and with this textthat ready to y something like this.It's looking really very beautiful rightnow. Now after thisuh this divactually this one we have to createanother div with class name just textcenterand animatedanimate fade in. Yeah. Now inside herewe have to create another div with classname like this.You can just read from here. Now insideherewe can add on H3 tag like 200 plus moretemplatesand then this is just unlike a staticdata. You can definitely make itdynamic.

You can just read it andthese these are the class name thateverything here and you can see 200 plusmore templates and browse all templates.It's looking really beautiful right nowand that's it. Our template section isalso done right now. What next? Sincetemplate is done right now, we can startour pricing section. Another interestingsection. So, uh in this modules, let'screate a new folder by giving namepricing and index.tsx.So, pricing section andimport it and save it. Now in pricingsection again let's add uh our thatsection ID will be pricing and classname will be like this. Then",

Theninside herewe can add ourcard component. So card component isgoing to be something like this. Let'simport cart from component/UI card. Class name is crazy big. Youcan see this is the class name.

Now after thisuh our pricing section is also ready.Our pricing section is also done. Rightnow what next? The next one is uhactually CTA section meanings call toaction. So we can copy the name. We cancome back in this modules. We can createa new folder by giving name CTAand index.tsxandCTAs section. We can save that and wecan import CTA section here. Yeah. NowCTS sectionuh here.

There's nothing else inhere like no functionalities. It'scompletely static this part. So, uh letme quickly add it and I am showing youthe full code one by one. Okay, it thiswill be better actually because uhthere's nothing toexplain you or like you know there'snothing complex things here. I can justexplain nothing here. It's just classnames and everything here. Okay. So letme save it and let me just little bit dounzoom then you can see the full codefrom here.You can just read one by one if you needbecause if you hover it",

So letme save it and let me just little bit dounzoom then you can see the full codefrom here.You can just read one by one if you needbecause if you hover it you will see thevalue of the class names. Okay. Sothere's nothing to explain here.You can just read it one by one.That's it. Yeah. And this is the sectionthe call to actions. You can seesomething like this. It's lookingactually beautiful. Uh by the way theschedule demo I want to change one thinghere and that is after doing hover thetext color will be white.Yeah. Now looks good. So that's it. Youcan see it's looking actually beautiful.Right now the last section not sectionit's actually a component and it'sfooter. So footer let's add footer here.Let's copy the name.Let's come back I mean collapseeverything and come back as components.Create a new folder by giving namefooterand index.tsx.So footer and instead of div let'schange it with footer.and import it from uh actuallycomponents footer.",

Right.After this div uh this one, let's addanother paragraph tag with value likethis that the next generation workflowautomation platform with AI superpowersbuild, deploy and scale your automationseffortlessly with uh this class name.Yeah, something like this. Now after theparagraph, we can actually add somesocial medias, right? Like some socialmedias links. So let's import buttonfrom UI button and our some icons likeTwitter icon, GitHub icon and messagecircle icon.Yeah.So Twitteruh GitHub and this is I think forDiscord. Okay.

So forworking with authentication let's closeeverything. Let's back in header andclose everything. Yeah. All right. Sofor implementing authentication,we just need to make here another statethat each is O open and set each O openinitial value will be false. Right? Nowlet's come back to this completelybottom after this div.We can say uh actually not here afterthis sheetwe can say actually we can add here ouro modeland let's call our o model we have",

Andinside here we can create Odot model.tsx.Yeah. And we can actually create here anO model. And we canimport O model and inside O model wehave to receive that is open andactually our onopen chains and the typewill be O model props. So we can justcreate here on simple interface thatinterface o model props we have to addis open and on open chains is open willbe boolean on onopen chains will be oncallback function so open will beboolean and it it's going to return onvoid.

Uh hereit's giving on deprecated warning and Iknow how to fix it. We just have tochange it to Z. Yeah. Souh in login schema we just need emailand password. In login form we needemail and password. For sign up we needfirst name, last name, email, passwordand confirm password. Yeah. And we arealso checking that is the confirmpassword is matching with the passwordor not. If not matching then password uhdon't match and path is confirm. Yeah.Uh right now here inside here weactually need some use state hook. Weactually need a multiple use state",

I know it'snot looking perfect yet, but at leastit's coming here. Okay, the model isappearing here. Right now, let's do thedesigning work right now. One by one.After this logo, this one, let's addanother div with class name spaceY4and uh merging top will be minus 70pixel. Now here let's add another H2with something like this that automateeverything our that uh like brandingtext we can say that automate everythingsmarterand then after this we can add uh oneparagraph simple paragraph thatjoin thousands of developers willing thefeatures of workflow automations with AIsuperpowers.

Uh here afterthis two actually I did a small mistake.The link should be ending here.uh 1 minuteand even the div itself.So we can just delete on div from thereand here you go. Now it's lookingbeautiful actually. Yeah. So after thistwo div right now we can add somebackground elements. Okay. Someanimations elements. So something likethis that our those actually likecircles you can see this one this onethis one it's actually lookingbeautiful. You can just check it fromhere. Very simple animation.

Then wedon't need to actually come out. Uh wedon't need to add extra space here.Yeah, now looks good. So you may addrace. Now after thisuh we need our password, right? So forpassword it's going to be also similarlike our login one, login form one.Okay. So passwordand passwordit must be at least eight characters.

So we can just add that in here ondiv with on button.We can save. So I agree to the terms anduh terms of service and privacy policy.We can add here definitely some link ifwe want. And that's actually the bestway. But since we don't have any privacypolicy for now, that's we just addinghere on simple div. Yeah simple buttonwith just this uh hover underline classname.

We don't have to doanything by ourselves. This is a goodthing. But let's drag it and take it insource folder at first. Then drag it andtake it inside our DV folder. Yeah,perfect. And uh here we need ondrizzle config. I don't know why it'smissing here yet, but let's see. Uhbetter cla migration. Actually, let'screate it by ourself. No problem. Ithink I forgot some command that's whyit's missing. However, we can create it.So, drizzledot config.ts ts inside here it's asmall file let's import config fromdrizzle kit so we have to uh installdrizzle kit right now so npmi drizzlekit uh dialect will be postsql andschema this is very important so thisone will",

H O schema is also perfect. So wedidn't write that by ourself. It's aninteresting thing. Now let's come backhere again and you can see so manythings here. But we don't have to worryfor anything. We're going to create ourauthentication flow by ourself rightnow.So let's come in this o.ts again andthis time we're going to do a lot ofwork. Uh after this provider let's addschemafor userit's going to be o schema. So o schemais actually coming fromouro schema. So we can do one thing we cansay import everything as o",

So enabled trueand require email verification. Yeah,it's also true. We're going to mustverify our email. Now email verificationhere. We have to do a lot of work rightnow. We have to right now sendverification email.So as syncuser URLand tokenthen inside here constant finalURLit's going to be our app URL plus thisURL. Okay, this is our authenticationURL.

Actually, right nowwe have to call our internal emailservice and we have to send an email toour user with this final word. We'regoing to do that. But for now after thislet's add some more options thatuh actually here that passwordson minute. Yeah I'm correct.

Sobe make sure that you are using thisnext cookies from better/nextjs.It's on plugins. Yeah, we can save it.But our work is not done here. We haveto send an email to our user with thisfinal URL. Otherwise, how the user willactivate the account.So let's start by creating a new folderin this src folder by giving nameservices. Inside the services we'regoing to actually create on emailservice file right now. So email serviceinside here we have to do a lot ofcoding right now. So first of all wehave to install some libraries like uhEJSand secondly node mailer for sendingemailsand import EJS from EJSimport uh path from path it's a built-inlibrary so we don't need to install itagain and importnode mailerfrom node mailer.So node mailer I think we have toinstall the type version if I'm notwrong.",

Yeah. So let's copy this and addit in here. Same for this one.Sotypes node mailer. Let's install it.Uh definitely it's going to take sometime and it's taking actually long time.Okay, my Wi-Fi network is connect. Uhcorrect. Fine. Uh it's done. Right. Nowlet's create here on transporter. Weneed this for sending an email. Sotransporternode mailer dot create transporthost it's going to be process do env dotsmtphostafter this let's add our portso smtp port and our service SMTPservice and the O for our username andpassword. Okay. So I will definitelyshow you how we will get all of theseenvironment variables. No worries. Afterthis we have to create here oninterface. So we can also export thisinterface. So export interfaceemail data.Andjust a minute let me turn off my roomAC.Yeah, done. Uh after",
      "variables. No worries. Afterthis we have to create here oninterface. So we can also export thisinterface. So export interfaceemail data.Andjust a minute let me turn off my roomAC.Yeah, done.

So that's why we're addingthis and on keyon array of string and type will be any.Now after this we can create on emailservice class. So emailserviceand here we're going to just create anbasic object oriented class. Thenprivate statica sync render template. So, we're goingto actually use your template. Why? Sothat we can send multiple uh like emailtemplate. Okay? Because we're going touse this email service not only forsending uh the user registration linkbut also for so many other things.That's why we're going to use",
      "multiple uh like emailtemplate. Okay?

Now inside hereuh constant template path it's going tobe template path not name and that pathdot joinprocess dotcwd. It means that this method actuallyreturns the current working directory ofthe NodeJS process. As you can see, souh current directory CWD. So it'sactually going to uh like return as thecurrent working directory. Yeah. Then wecan add here or that src folder. So uhfirst of all this process cwd isreturning in this root directory.

We can say send email.Then two which going to be stringsubject which going to be string as welland HTMLit's also going to be string and it'sgoing to returnon boolean.

So return false. Uhwe can add on console lock if there isany error that error sendingemail and what is the reason. So let'sprint the error message in console. Yeahin our server console. That's it done.Right now we need somemore function. Uh let'scollapse it and let's add another onefor email verification.It's very simple that's why I just copypasted it.

So render template is actuallycoming from here okay from this emailservice class.So then from here we are actuallybypassing or passing actually our uhemail template name. Okay. And thenwe're passing the data in here. So uh weare actually sending this email to thisdata.2. Okay. Data.2 means it's actuallycoming from here. So when we're going tocall this function, we must have to passthe data and from the data we aresending this data.2 two because insidedata we must have on two value. You cansee two is a string meanings for whichuser or which email we are sending theemail. That's it. This is the subjectthat verify your email address and flowtext and this is the HTML content.Uh yeah that's it. Uh for now it's goodenough for us. Okay. We don't needanything else",

We don't needanything else for now. For now it's goodenough. If we need anything else we'regoing to add that later. Yeah. Let'scome back in this o.ts right now. Andfrom here we can easily call our emailservice.So email service dot send uhverification email and we have to bypassthe data. So we have to pass the datanot bypass. So let's send our user dotemail. This is the to user right? We aresending this to this email. Uh theusername it's also going to be user dotname and URL definitely it's going to bethis final URL. Yeah. Done. So herewe're actually sending the email. Looksperfect.Uh and after this everything is done inhere in this o.tsbut this email service will not workbecause we must have to add all of thisenviable in here.

Uh yeah actuallydone. The SMTP host port service userand password setup is actually donehere. Uh right now we can do one thing.We can come back here again.Let's back here.Give on reload. Nothing will actuallywork yet because we have to create someimportant APIs. So let's come back inthis app folder. Let's create a newfolder by giving name API. And insideAPI folder, we have to create anotherfolder by giving name O.Inside O we can actually create sign upand another folder that login in this ofolder. Okay. Uh login sign up and logoutand meand uh another onethat's going to be verify email. Sorry.In this O folder that verifyemail. So",
      "create sign upand another folder that login in this ofolder. Okay. Uh login sign up and logoutand meand uh another onethat's going to be verify email. Sorry.In this O folder that verifyemail. So verify email. Yeah. All done.These are the routes we must need.Perfect. So let's do one thing in thissign up. Let's create our root dot GSfile and let's copy this file and addall of these in all of these folders.So done. Login, log out, uh sign up,verify email, all done. Now in this signup,we just have to write some few lines ofcode. So first of all, importOfromour lib and O. Now we have to alsoimport our next response.Yeah. Now after this let's write exportas sync. This is going to be on postrequest. So export as sync post.H disgusting. Inside here let's addrequestandoh I forgot to add the function. Yep.That's why I'm thinking what'shappening. Okay. Nowconstant body we're going to receive itfrom our request dot JSON.Now constant emailuh passwordand name all of these are coming frombody. Now",
      "Yep.That's why I'm thinking what'shappening. Okay. Nowconstant body we're going to receive itfrom our request dot JSON.Now constant emailuh passwordand name all of these are coming frombody.

Okay but for next days weuse here request.json.Now uh here we can call our o dot apidot sign up uh emailand here we have to pass ouremailthen password and the name we havereceived from the front end. Yeah.Now after this we can return nextresponse dot JSONand here let's add on messagethat sign up successful and please checkyour email and click the verificationlink to activate your account. Then wehave to add here the status code whichwill be actually 200. Yeah, if it'scatch any error then what we're going todo we're going to actually return onnext response dojson with this errormessage. So error we can say error dotmessage and status will be 400. That'sit. Our sign up route work is actuallydone. Right now after sign up",
      "actually return onnext response dojson with this errormessage. So error we can say error dotmessage and status will be 400. That'sit. Our sign up route work is actuallydone. Right now after sign up the nextimportant route is our route dot uhsorry our this verify email route. Yes.Okay. Inside here we're going to doeverything similar like our previousfunction just uh this will be get okayinstead of post this will be get nowwe're going to get our URL and tokenfrom our URL okay or request dot URL andwe're going to get on token on likesearch params from this URL and then ifthere is no token it means the link isnot valid it's basically after the useris clicking the verification link fromfrom the email. Okay. So when there istoken missing it means it's actually notvalid. Yeah. Then after that we cancheck for ourlike we can uh use on track catchstatement and we can go to thisoapi.verifyemail. We can query this we can do onquery with this token. Yeah we areactually doing query with this",
      "we cancheck for ourlike we can uh use on track catchstatement and we can go to thisoapi.verifyemail. We can query this we can do onquery with this token. Yeah we areactually doing query with this token.After that if everything is fine theemail is verified then email verifiedsuccessfully we're just sending on 200request like on like uh successresponse. Yes right the 200 is thesuccess response status code. So emailverified successfully and your use youraccount right now activated. You can dologin. That's it. Our verify email workis also done. Let's quickly make thelogin one too. It's also going to bekind of similar not exactly similar. Soat first do the same work again. Thisone is also going to be postand we are getting data from ourrequest.json from the body meanings fromour front end. Then we're actuallyreceiving here email and passwordbecause this is login. Then let's usehere on try catch statement. Now insideherein this trip part we're going toactuallydo on small thing that oapi",
      "Then we're actuallyreceiving here email and passwordbecause this is login. Then let's usehere on try catch statement. Now insideherein this trip part we're going toactuallydo on small thing that oapi signs signin email. So this is actually the methodprovided by beta. Okay this o is comingfrom here. You can see this o isactually coming from betaroth. That'swhy we're using this oapi signin imageand we are passing this email andpassword to better. so that better oathcan handle everything for us. We're notwriting any manual logic. Better oath isdoing everything for us. That's why it'sactually we can say more secret than ournormal code. Yeah, now it's returningsession data. Better handles cookiesetting automatically. So we don't needto do anything. We just have to passthis session in here. We're just likeyou know giving on response uh for thisAPI. That's it. If there is any error,this is very important because we haveto write here some external thing. Solet's make it something like this.",
      "just likeyou know giving on response uh for thisAPI. That's it. If there is any error,this is very important because we haveto write here some external thing. Solet's make it something like this. Andlet's say any now if it's an emailverification error very importantbecause there might be something that onuser didn't verify the email and tryingto doing the login. So we have to likenotice the user that the your email isnot verified. So please verify emailaddress before logging in and check youremail for the verification linkotherwise we can send the normal errorif there is any normal error. Yeah youcan just check the logic it's verysimple actually. H so our login break isalso done. Now the log out it's going tobe very smallbecause we are doing everything withbetter. So we just have to use this allAPIs sign out. We have to pass theheaders and it's coming from request doheaders. That's it. Yeah. And last onethat is me meaningshere we will get the logged in userinformations. Okay. So in me",
      "allAPIs sign out. We have to pass theheaders and it's coming from request doheaders. That's it. Yeah. And last onethat is me meaningshere we will get the logged in userinformations. Okay. So in me it's alsogoing to be just a small function. Youcan see it's definitely going to be onget request. I mean uh this APIendpoint. Then we can say oapi.getsession. And we can just pass thisrequest. That's it. If there is nosession then user there is no useravailable and status is 401. Okay.Otherwise we can pass the userinformation to the API response. That'sit. Our all APIs are ready right now.It's ready to use. Let's implement it. Imean let's use it inside our o modelright now. So for using it we're goingto do one more smart thing and that iswe're going to create here on anotherhook so thatwe can use it perfectly. So first of allwe need here on hook for our allauthentication APIs. Okay. So let'screate here use o ts.Let's make it client side at firstbecause we're going to actually add allof our",
      "it perfectly. So first of allwe need here on hook for our allauthentication APIs. Okay. So let'screate here use o ts.Let's make it client side at firstbecause we're going to actually add allof our functions here. Okay, functionsmeanings from herelike from here we're going to actuallykeep all of our authentication APIrequest logic we can say. So ID uh thisis our user type. So in user we haveuser ID, user email. I mean there are somany fields but we need these fields. SoID, emailname,string and email verified or not. Soit's very important. So email verifiedit's going to be boolean.Yeah. Now after thisexport ouruse o hook. So use oand inside here let's add on use user Imean sorry user and use user set user asan state hook. Then after this we needsome more use state hook like loadingand error state.After this we can write here our sign upfunction. So we can saysignup and uh here we can create an asyncfunction async functionand the name will be actually sign upand uh instead of params we",

Yeah. Nowinside here first of all set loadingwill be trueand set error it's going to be null bydefault. Now let's add on try catchstatement and let's write our mainlogic. So we're going to actually sendhereon API request to our API o and sign upthis API endpoint which we created justsome time agomethod is going to be definitely postheaders just application/jsonand we are sending our this data thisname email and password from here fromthe parameter which we received thenwhen we are receiving on response we'reshowing in the response otherwise we ifthere is any error then we're throwing anew error from here that sign up failednow uh here actually not OTP steps uh wecan say verification email",

So errordotmessage make the error state type to anyand finallyset loading will be false. That's it.Uh now our sign up is actually done. Thesign up function let's do one thing.Let's create another one for verifyemail. So verify emailverify email and we're going to createit right now. It's going to be also asmall function. We must have to write itby ourselves. We're just writing thefront end logics right now. So verifyemailthe same thing here again set loadingtrue set error is going to be null.

We can saywe are just adding here set user becauseafter doing sorry after verifying emailwe are getting our users data. That'swhy we are adding that in here. Yeah.Now what next? Definitely login rightlike common sense we can say. So nextone is login after verify email. Solet's come back hereand guess what login is also going to beactually same because we are justsending here like request to our APIs.That's it. Uh I think I done a smallmistake.No.Okay. Okay. I'm I'm explaining. Sorry.There is a small error because I didn'tcreate on function yet. That's why uhlet's remove the gap. H now it's lookingperfect.Okay. Sosame thing here.

But before me, let's create thelog out and me together because smalljust five six lines of quotes we cansay. So log out we're just sending onrequest to this log out endpoint. Methodis post and set user null. For me we'resending request here and we are justadding the data in this set user state.Yeah, that's it. And finallyfinally we can return all of these.

Souserloadingerror then sign upverify emailuh logactually loginthen log out.So log out and me. Yeah, done. So use ohook work is actually done. This waskind of big but this was the most usefulthing we can say in our this fullauthentication workflow because we'regoing to right now have no problem toimplement the authentications perfectly.Our use o hook is ready. We need anothersmall hook. This is important because weneed our user informations in so manyplaces. So let's create another hook bygiving name use user.ts. Okay, we needour logged in user information in somany places. So we're going to actuallyuse here on library called SWR.So import use SWR from SWRand we have to install it. Actually Iforgot the uses of this library as Iknow it's something like uh for datafacing. I know it's for data facing butthere are some like great benefits ofthis. So with sw components",
      "install it. Actually Iforgot the uses of this library as Iknow it's something like uh for datafacing. I know it's for data facing butthere are some like great benefits ofthis. So with sw components will get astream of data update cont constantlyand automatically uh and the UI will bealways fast and reactive. So it's Ithink kind of like our that you knowarticle query we can say. So in thisexample the s use sw hooks accept a keyand a feature function key is an uniqueidentifier of the data normally they payURL and will be passed to featurefeature can be any asynchronous functionwhich returns the data you can use thenative face or tools like exosokay so there are so many uh features inswer library it's actually just on reacthook for data facing Okay. Yeah, that'swe're using it. So, let's install it.npm SWR.Now, let's add here our type for user. Ithink we do have this already here.

Now in here we're going toreceive lot of props okay because it'sgoing to be a reusable component that'swe're going to receive title valuesubtitle progress trend action and classname and we can define oninterface for all of these types. So KPIcard drops let's copy this. Let's createon basic interface here with all theselike props values like title will be onstring.Value will be string or number. Subtitleit's going to be string and progressit's going to be number. Train it can beup, down or neutral. Action it can belike this. You can just read it. Andclass name like this. Yeah. Now hereinstead of uh uh like div let's let'simport here card from our cardcomponent. Okay. Now in this card let'sadd on class name. So class name we canactually use here CN from lies. Then bgcolor will be actually likethis. Then after this we",
      "here card from our cardcomponent. Okay. Now in this card let'sadd on class name. So class name we canactually use here CN from lies. Then bgcolor will be actually likethis. Then after this we need on bordercolor kind of similar like turkish colorlike this and after doing on hoverborder green border will be green 500 by30 then transition all uh the transitionduration will be 200 millisecond. Yeah,after this if any user want to add anycustom class name so that we can giveoption here and user can easily able touser users will be easily able to addthe class name not users we should saydevelopers because not user is addingany anything here right only developersare doing code yeah now card contentit's coming from components and UI cardinside here as we created here carddefinitely web here card content likenatural thing we can say and it shouldnot be any like just self-closingcomponent no it's on card content andhere we can say class nameP6and inside here we can add on div withclass name",
      "content likenatural thing we can say and it shouldnot be any like just self-closingcomponent no it's on card content andhere we can say class nameP6and inside here we can add on div withclass name item center justify bitbetween and MBCool. Yeah, we can add here another H3thattextSMfont mediumtext gray 400and we can add the title in here. Yeah,that's it.And if there is any action availablethen we can add here on a button fromcomponent cy button. Uh the buttonvariant will bethe ghost variant. So variantuh not hero ghost and after this size isgoing to be smand on clickit's going to call action dot on click.Yeah. Class nameit's going to be text xstext green 400 uh green actually.Then after this after doing on hoverit's going to be text green300 H will be six px will be twoand action dot level. Yeah done. Nowafter this div let's add another divwith class name MB2.Let's add another div with class nametextto Excelfont boldtext white and we can pass here thevaluethen subtitle if it's",
      "level. Yeah done. Nowafter this div let's add another divwith class name MB2.Let's add another div with class nametextto Excelfont boldtext white and we can pass here thevaluethen subtitle if it's available thenlet's add on div with class name text SMtext gray 500 it. Yeah. And we can passthe subtitle.Simple.Uh after this this component is not doneyet. The last thing just one small thingwe need to write here that if theprogress is actually not undefinedthen the DV class name will be space Y1and on progress the value will be theprogress. The class name will be thisone. This is the progress like uhpercentage we can say. Now let's comeback here in this KPI card and we'regoing to actually pass lot of thingsright now. First of all on title thatactive workflows value uh we can do onething.We can actuallymake it 10 for now. Okay. We can make itstatic. No problem. Like 10 runningautomations. Okay. Okay, we we have tomake it dynamic and we will do thatlater with our dynamic database. Uh",
      "can actuallymake it 10 for now. Okay. We can make itstatic. No problem. Like 10 runningautomations. Okay. Okay, we we have tomake it dynamic and we will do thatlater with our dynamic database. Uh KPIcard this one done. Let's copy this.Let's paste again here and this time howmany runs. Okay, in the last 30 day. Sowe can saythe value will be five. Okay, let's saysince this is on just static data rightnow and we can say total execution. Sototal executionsit's going to be five. Uh fine. So totalexecutions five. Uh after this successrate which is also going to bekind of similar. So let's add heresuccess rate. Success rate like it canit can be like you know anything. It canbe four or five just anything. Uh buthere progress is important. Okay.Because this is on percentage that's whyso progress is let's say 90%.Subtitle also important we can sayoverall reliability. Okay something likethis. So success rate. Yeah. Now afterthis we can add our credits left likehow many credits still you have.",
      "is let's say 90%.Subtitle also important we can sayoverall reliability. Okay something likethis. So success rate. Yeah. Now afterthis we can add our credits left likehow many credits still you have. Socredit leftand the value we can say actually likeuh 100 credits left. Okay. Progress wecan say 90 and subtitle we can say usesremaining. So uses remaining and actionthere is going to be an actions thatupgrade and it's going to like call thishandle upgrade function. Let's create onhandle upgradefunction. Yeah. And we're going to breakhere later. So handle upgrade.Uh 1 minute KPI card. Let's do onething.Let's make it client side component. Souse client. Yeah.One click event handlers cannot bepassed to client client props. Huh. Thensince this is in server side that's whythe problem is happening. Actually wehave to do here some data facing datafing. So we can also make it client sidebecause we're going to also use your usestate token. We have to make it clientside. That's why. So fine let's",
      "Actually wehave to do here some data facing datafing. So we can also make it client sidebecause we're going to also use your usestate token. We have to make it clientside. That's why. So fine let's make itclient side. This is the upgrade buttonthat credits left.Now after thislet's do one thing after this div orthis row work is done. Okay, the firstrow let's start the second row work. Nowlet's add on class name something likethis that grid grid calls one from LGgrid calls three and gap six.Let's add another DIVlike this that LG from LG call span willbe two. Let's add here our card thatrecent runs. So let's import cart fromcomponents eyheader from same card title same andcurt content same. Now run table this isgoing to be another component. Okay runtable is going to be another componentbut for now let's just keep here ondummy data. Okay for now something likethis. Okay recent runs. So here we'regoing to add all of our recent runs likeum list of recent like it it's actuallylogs okay it's",
      "now let's just keep here ondummy data. Okay for now something likethis. Okay recent runs. So here we'regoing to add all of our recent runs likeum list of recent like it it's actuallylogs okay it's going to be kind of likelogs so here not logs sorry it's goingto run table okay so fine this is uh fornow this is fine we're going to uhcreate here on run table component uh orwe can also create it right now and wecan just keep this paragraph right nowin there okay so let's create here onrun table componentWe have to create itin here in this dashboard. So runtableindex.tsxand oh sorry runtable and inside here let's add this.Done. Let's import it. And here you go.Cool. Since we don't have enough data, Imean dynamic data that's why we're justmaking it completely standard right nowbecause we should focus more in the corelogic right now, not in the UI or likeoptional things. Yeah, that's it. Afterthis div,we can back we can add another div thatsystem feed. Okay, it's going to beanother",
      "we should focus more in the corelogic right now, not in the UI or likeoptional things. Yeah, that's it. Afterthis div,we can back we can add another div thatsystem feed. Okay, it's going to beanother component. And for now, let'sadd here some loads. I think I didmistake.Uh yeah, we have to add it here.There should be three diff at the end.Yeah, now it's in the same row. So herewill be actually live lock tracker.Okay, you will be able to see yourworkflow locks and we're going toactually uh like implement that in thesecond part of this tutorial series.Okay, and second means the last part.We're going to implement that live lockswith another internal service ofourself. Yeah, that's it for our for nowour this dashboard work is actually donesince it's completely static right now.Now what we're going to start right nowworkflows or templates. So we shouldstart template first because fromtemplates we will be able to create somany workflows. Okay, definitely we canalso create workflow without",
      "going to start right nowworkflows or templates. So we shouldstart template first because fromtemplates we will be able to create somany workflows. Okay, definitely we canalso create workflow without templatesbut with templates it's the easiestoption. So let's do it right nowin this dashboard. Let's create a newfolder thatworkflows.So workflowsand page.tsx.Sowe can say workflows.Yeah.Then next one is going to be templates.So templatesand page.tsx.Yeah, we can save it.Here you go. Workflows templates ready.Let's start to work for templates rightnow. So let's close all the files andlet's come back in this templates.All right. So let's delete the page fromhere and at first we have to make it onclient side component because we'regoing to use here lot of state like usestate use effect. So that's why we musthave to make it client side component.So first of all let's add here three usestate hook.One for search term. Another one forselected category and set selectedcategory. Another one that",
      "why we musthave to make it client side component.So first of all let's add here three usestate hook.One for search term. Another one forselected category and set selectedcategory. Another one that previewtemplate and set preview template wherethe use state initial value will betemplate or I mean uh not initial valuethe use this uh preview template typewill be template or null and by defaultnull. So template is actually comingfrom another file. We have to createthat. Let's go to this leaf folderand in here we have to create a mock.tsbut it's already in here because Icreated it in offline. But no worriesfor you. You will find out this file inthat notion link. You just have to go tomy video description box. You will findout that notion link. In there you willfind out this mock.ts file. B make surethat you are copying this everything.It's very very important. It's actuallyour templates our mock templates andhere is our that uh template interface.So we can simply import the templatefrom",
      "surethat you are copying this everything.It's very very important. It's actuallyour templates our mock templates andhere is our that uh template interface.So we can simply import the templatefrom lib and mock and we can save itright now. Right now we have to make anarray for our categories. So let's justgo to this mock templates because wedon't have any categories array. we arejust like taking all the categories fromhere and we are just like you knowsummarizing that inside on like uh onvariable. So in this categories rightnow we have all of our categories we cansay. Now we have to create anotherfunction for filtering our templates.It's very very important. It's actuallyworking when we are searching anytemplates or we are adding any filterthen this filter templates is filteringour templates from the from this mockdata. Okay. Now mock templates sincethis is an array. So that's why we'redoing here on filter method. So mocktemplates dot filter and template andmatches search template dot",
      "from the from this mockdata. Okay. Now mock templates sincethis is an array. So that's why we'redoing here on filter method. So mocktemplates dot filter and template andmatches search template dot name.2 lowercase. So why we're using here twolowerase? Because if you notice here thename is not case sensitive. So that'swhy when the user is typing something weare also changing that into a lowercase. Okay. So that like you know ifeven you are writing uh like stripe likethis then still this option will appearin the stripes result. Okay. This namestripeyou don't have to write S with capitalletter. Okay. So it's not case sensitivewe can say. Now uh filter templates isready here. Right. Now what next? Afterthis we just needon small functioncalled handle use template. And for nowthis function is going to be just onconsole lock. Okay for now like uh usetemplate for now we can say we will workhere later. So use template.Now after this we need anotherpunchion for handlereviewwhere we're going to",
      "to be just onconsole lock. Okay for now like uh usetemplate for now we can say we will workhere later. So use template.Now after this we need anotherpunchion for handlereviewwhere we're going to receive templatewhich going to be on string uh notstring actuallyit's going to be the template. Yeah. Nowlet's call the set preview template andpass this template in here. Cool. Now uhin this return the first div let's let'sadd here class name like this that P6and space Y 6. Now here let's add onsmall static header that get startedquickly with pre-built automationtemplates. If you right now come hereyou can see it's actually looking verybeautiful. Now after this divwe can right now add our filters fortemplate. So filters let's add here ondivsomething like this kind of big you cansee the class names you can just read itby yourself. Now inside this div let'slet's add another small div somethinglike this that search it's coming fromlucid react input it's coming fromcomponents and UI input you can",
      "you can just read itby yourself. Now inside this div let'slet's add another small div somethinglike this that search it's coming fromlucid react input it's coming fromcomponents and UI input you can justread the class name from here this isour search templates input when we'rewriting something then we're callingthis set search term and it's actuallyapplying the filters you can see herewith this filter template templates.It's actually working. So no worries. Wewill right now write the code for filtertemplates. But after this, let me showyou how this is looking here. It'sactually looking beautiful. Now afterthis div, when the div is ending, let'sadd here another div. It's going to bekind of big something like this. So thisis for our categories.The categories array we which variablewe created here that categories allcategories then categories do map andthe category the key is category likeunique key and variant if the selectedcategories matching with this categorythen default otherwise",
      "here that categories allcategories then categories do map andthe category the key is category likeunique key and variant if the selectedcategories matching with this categorythen default otherwise outline aftergiving on click we are setting thiscategory in this set selected categorystate and when the selected category ismatching with this category then we arewriting this is styling Otherwise thisis styling. If the category is equals towall then we just writing the firstletter to a I mean the first a iscapital here so that it looks morebeautiful and more natural. That's it.Otherwise category here. So you can seeall integration workflow core workflowand automation. We should do one morething hereafter doing on hover. Let's make thetext color white. So it's lookingactually more beautiful. right now.Yeah. Now finally we need our thatfilter templates button. So after thisdiv after this div let's add our filtertemplates button. Let's add filter iconfrom lucid react and batch from",
      "right now.Yeah. Now finally we need our thatfilter templates button. So after thisdiv after this div let's add our filtertemplates button. Let's add filter iconfrom lucid react and batch from ourcomponents. Now filter templatesdotlength and template and if the lengthis not one then let's add one s liketemplates otherwise simple template likesingular and plural. Yeah, right now wecan actually save it. You can see whenI'm adding any like when I'm clickinghere it's showing me that in thiscategory we have on template in thiscategory we have two templates here wehave five templates you can see it'sactually looking beautiful right now nowfinally after all of this what we needwe need our template grid right ourtemplate data so we can add ourtemplate grid here so let's add here onlogic simple logic that if our filtertemplates length is more than zero thenwhat we have to do we have to add hereon simple grid div I mean on di withclass name grid and grid calls one thisis for mobile screen this",
      "that if our filtertemplates length is more than zero thenwhat we have to do we have to add hereon simple grid div I mean on di withclass name grid and grid calls one thisis for mobile screen this is for tabletscreen and this is for uh laptop screenand like more bigger than laptop screenand everywhere gap six means 24 pixellike the gap between all the items.Yeah. Now after this when there is notemplates what we can do we can add hereon message thatuh no templates found. Try adjustingyour search terms or category filtersand you can see or read the class namesone by one. Yeah let's save it. Here yougo. So all of these categories hastemplates. Yeah, that's why it's showingnothing. Now inside this div, let's comeback here andlet's add our template card componenthere. We have to create this templatecard component actually. Uh but I did ona small mistake. Let me cut it. Let mewrite this template sorry filtertemplates dot mapand templatesince this is an array so that's why weare writing this",
      "component actually. Uh but I did ona small mistake. Let me cut it. Let mewrite this template sorry filtertemplates dot mapand templatesince this is an array so that's why weare writing this loop. Now inside herelet's call that template card. Now wehave to create this template cardcomponent. In this components folder,dashboard folder, let's create a newfolder by giving them template and let'screate a new folder by giving themtemplate card and index.tsx.Yeah. Nowwe can say rafce and template card.Let's make it on client side component.Yeah, we can save it. We can import thatand we can come back here. Now in thistemplate card at first we have toreceive thistemplate one use template and onepreview and the type will be actuallythis template card props. We can saysomething like this. The template typeis template coming from our lib andmock. Now here we can add the templatecard props. That's it. Done. Now atfirst we're going to use your own hookcalled router. Uh one minute hereactually and",
      "typeis template coming from our lib andmock. Now here we can add the templatecard props. That's it. Done. Now atfirst we're going to use your own hookcalled router. Uh one minute hereactually and we are going to use it forredirecting our users to a differentpage like when any user is clicking thisuse it use this template we willredirect our user to that page. Yeah.Now we need another helper function wecan say. It's just like get iconcomponent we can say. So get iconcomponent and it's going to receive onicon name which type will be stringinside here. Let's create on icon mapbecausefor our thisuh templates we're going to use someemoji not icon. Why emoji? Because thatwill make the design more beautiful.That's it. Nothing else. So in this iconmap, let's add our credit card. When theicon name is credit card, then let's usethis emoji. You will find out all ofthis emoji on Google or even if you havelike uh in your laptop if you have theemoji feature, you can find out itinside your keyword",
      "is credit card, then let's usethis emoji. You will find out all ofthis emoji on Google or even if you havelike uh in your laptop if you have theemoji feature, you can find out itinside your keyword or also you can findout it on Google if you are not findingout it. It's the credit card, it's filetext, it's mail and it's way. Yeah. Uhfinally we have to return the icon mapandactually icon name sorryicon nameor initially we need onsearch uh sorry not search settingsemoji. Yeah that's it. Nowlet's create here another function onsmall function that use template handlerand it's going to be on call backfunction. It's going to push the user toslash dashboard/templatesand the template id. Yeah, done. Nowlet's come back in this return insteadof div let's let's use here curtbecause this is on curt component righttemplate curt. So let's import curt fromcomponents UI and cur and this is theclass name again I'm doing on small Imean I'm slowly moving it so that youcan read it carefully. Yeah. Now",
      "component righttemplate curt. So let's import curt fromcomponents UI and cur and this is theclass name again I'm doing on small Imean I'm slowly moving it so that youcan read it carefully. Yeah. Now afterthis let's add here card headerwith a class name PB3.Inside here let's add another DIVwithclass name like this that flex itemcenter justify between this is anotherdiv with that template icon and this ison badge with the template category. Youcan see it's looking right nowbeautiful. Now after this after this divlet's let's add our card title very veryimportant right so let's add our cardtitle with class name like this andlet's import cart title from our chat CNcomponents so card title and again it'slooking beautiful now after card titleour card header work is done right nowlet's move into card content so cardcontent and import content from ourcomponents. Then we have to add here ourtemplate descriptions like this. Okay,you can just see this is our templatedescriptions. After this,we",
      "card content so cardcontent and import content from ourcomponents. Then we have to add here ourtemplate descriptions like this. Okay,you can just see this is our templatedescriptions. After this,we have to add here another div. Andthis is very important. This is going tobe kind of bigger and kind of complex.You can seeuh here we have to add something likethis that template dot steps. Okay, it'san array. Template dot step is an array.Let me show you from here. The steps isan array of string, right? 1 2 and threesteps here. That's why we are slicingit. So 0 to three. Now dot mapstepand index.Now let's return it and let's comeinside here. DIV key will be indexand class name will be something likethis that flex item center space uh X2text SM and text gray 300. Inside here,let's add our scape name. Something likethis. You can just read from here. Now,you can see it's actually looking verybeautiful. These are our scapes, right?Like Stripe, notion, and then sendnotifications, Gmail, AI,",
      "name. Something likethis. You can just read from here. Now,you can see it's actually looking verybeautiful. These are our scapes, right?Like Stripe, notion, and then sendnotifications, Gmail, AI, generate, thendiscord, web, trigger, then GoogleSheets, then Slack. Okay, just thesteps. After thisafter this templates we can come hereand we can say template dot steps dotlength if it's more than threethenlet's add here on plus more steps likethis. Okay. So for an example here wehave four steps. So that's why it'sshowing plus one more steps. So if ithad like five steps then it will showplus two more steps. Okay the logic islike that template.steps.tlengthif it's more than three thentemplate.steps.tlengthminus three. Okay. So if it's like youknow 3 - 3 then 0. If it's 4 - 3 then 1.If it's 5 - 3 then two. So that's why itwill show one or two or three like that.Okay. like an common math we can sayafter thisuh after this two div actually no I'mdoing one small mistake hereafter this two div",
      "- 3 then two. So that's why itwill show one or two or three like that.Okay. like an common math we can sayafter thisuh after this two div actually no I'mdoing one small mistake hereafter this two div where is the anotherdiv just a minuteuhactually this div is starting here whereis the space y1 one.Okay, let's do one thing. Let's addhere.I did something mistake somewheresteps length fine.Okay. Buttemplate description fine.Uh I just realized the mistake wasactually here.We have to add on steps length likethis. Okay. So you can see steps three,three and four. Otherwise like we'rejust saying plus one more steps. Sowe're not saying the exact number of howmany steps here, right? The user have todo on math here. So that's why we'rejust saying okay fine there are foursteps here so you don't have to count itby yourself.Okay done. Uh then let me again see ifeverything okay or not. Is everythingokay or not here? Because if we aredoing anything wrongit can do some problem. Let me addanother",
      "have to count itby yourself.Okay done. Uh then let me again see ifeverything okay or not. Is everythingokay or not here? Because if we aredoing anything wrongit can do some problem. Let me addanother divwith class nameflex space x2 and pt2. Inside here weneed actuallytwo button thatuh use templateandpreview the template. Okay, this twobutton you can just read it. This is thediv starting from there and ending here.You can just read it.It's actually looking beautiful.Yeah, it's really looking beautiful. Ifwe click use template, it will take usto this template details screen whichnot exist yet. So, we have to createthat. We will do that. But for now, it'sactually looking perfect.Yeah, the design is looking beautiful.And that's it. Our template cardcomponent work is actually done. We cansave it. We can come back here in thistemplates again because it's notcompletely done yet. After this, we haveto do some more work and that is we havetopreview our dialogue. So previewdialogue means what?",
      "it. We can come back here in thistemplates again because it's notcompletely done yet. After this, we haveto do some more work and that is we havetopreview our dialogue. So previewdialogue means what?

Yeah. Nowinside here let's add our dialoguecontent. So dialogue content let'simport it from components UI anddialogue. Inside here let's add ourdialogue header.So dialogue header let's import it fromcomponents UI dialogue. Dialogue titlesame and dialogue description.Now you can just see you can just readit. It's a static thing. It's not anylike complex logical thing. You can justread it. It's very easy thing. Sopreview",

Sopreview template if available andtemplate icon is credit card then thisone. If uh the icon is file text thenthis one is mail then this one. Youmight be thinking then why did we addthat in hereover uh 1 minute. Actually that was inthe curt component. Okay, that was inthis current component, not in thistemplates page component. That's why weare doing it twice. Okay, here I wastalking about this one. So again, we aredoing that in here because it's in adifferent component, different page.Yeah. So we can save it now. Now you canseeit's looking actually perfect. Yeah. Nowstill it's not done. We have to finishit. It it was just the header thedialogue header is done. Right now weneed our dialog content. So when thepreview template is true or availablewhen the preview template has some datawe can add here",
      "It it was just the header thedialogue header is done. Right now weneed our dialog content. So when thepreview template is true or availablewhen the preview template has some datawe can add here another DIV with classname space Y 6 and MT6inside here we can add another DIV thatworkflow steps. It's similar like overthe card one. I mean our the templatecard. It has some sort of like littlebit UI difference. You can just read theclass name slowly. You will understandit. And the looks you can see it'sdifferent. It's not like this greenbuttons. I mean this green uh list wecan say. It's different. It's lookingactually more beautiful. And this is theworkflow steps. And it's really lookingbeautiful. Yeah. And this is the classname for creating this. This is the DIVclass and I mean DIV tag and classnames. You can just check it after thistwo div. Let's come back out from hereand let's add those buttons again thatuh like use this template or close thismodel. Yeah, something like this. So,use this",
      "You can just check it after thistwo div. Let's come back out from hereand let's add those buttons again thatuh like use this template or close thismodel. Yeah, something like this. So,use this template. Then let's call thehandle use template function and let'ssend the preview template and make theset preview template null. And this isthe class name. And here uh when someoneis pressing close then just make the setpreview template null. So it willautomatically close this model. Okay. Inclose we have to add one small thingthat after doing hover the text colorwill be white.Yeah, perfect. So, use this templateand close. If I click use this template,it's doing nothing. It's doing nothingbecause here it's just on console.log.That's why. But for now, we can do onething since we do have our dynamicvalue. We can copy that from thistemplate C and we can add that in herelike this. for router we can copy thislinethis use router line. Okay. So let'spaste that in here and let's import userouter from",
      "We can copy that from thistemplate C and we can add that in herelike this. for router we can copy thislinethis use router line. Okay. So let'spaste that in here and let's import userouter from next /navigation. We cansave it now.Perfect. Now what next? Our templatespage work is done. We have to right nowstart to work for templates details orthe main screen where we have to writelike 90% of the main logical things forour this project. Everything will bethere those o connections thenimplementing inest and all other thingswe have to do that in the templatedetails script because that's going tobe on workflow page user will be able tocreate on workflow from there that'swhy. So don't wasting time. Let's startthe main interesting work right now. Wecan close this templates. We can closethis mock.ts. We can come back here. Wecan call ups everything. We can go inthis dashboard templates and we can sayslag.And inside here let's create on page.tsxPSXand page. Now if we click here, it's notgoing",
      "We can come back here. Wecan call ups everything. We can go inthis dashboard templates and we can sayslag.And inside here let's create on page.tsxPSXand page. Now if we click here, it's notgoing to give any error. Now we can seeit's not giving any error.So perfect. Now next step is we have tostart to work in here. Right nowat first make this page to on clientside page because we're going to add somany states and so many things in thispage. Yeah. Now secondly since this ison dynamic routes or dynamic page so wehave to right now get back our parmsright which we are receiving from herefrom this slack. So params and we cansay use params from next slashnavigation. Now constant slag. Why it'sslag? Because this is the name. Our nameis actually slag here. Actually novariable name is fine but we have towrite here params. Slag. Okay. Why?Because the slag is in here. If we addanything else that's still going towork. But since this is slag that'swe're giving the variable name to slagas well.",
      "we have towrite here params. Slag. Okay. Why?Because the slag is in here. If we addanything else that's still going towork. But since this is slag that'swe're giving the variable name to slagas well. Yeah. So, params dot uh slackas string. Now, next we need our userdata which is coming from use user hook.So, let's import use user from hooks anduse user.Now, after this we're going to need alot of use state hook. So first of allwe're going to add three use state hookand it's actually forreact flow manage state for nodes andages plus like current selections likewhich node or state currently we areselecting. Okay so uh we need this usenode state and uh you might be thinkingfrom where this use node state uh sorrystate and use age state is coming. Noworries. Let me show you from where it'scoming. So it's actually coming from alibrary called React flow which we'regoing to use for creating our thatdragger canvas. Okay. Where like we willbe able user will be able to like createmore nodes or",
      "So it's actually coming from alibrary called React flow which we'regoing to use for creating our thatdragger canvas. Okay. Where like we willbe able user will be able to like createmore nodes or drag the nodes or add anew one or modify any node in theworkflow. Okay, something like that. Solet's install our React flow libraryright now. So for installing React Flow,let's write npmi and React flow and justwait a little bit until it's finishingthe installation. And let's import ReactFlow and React Flow and D style dot CSSfor the styling. and import react flowbackground controls use node state useages state add age node and connectionfrom react flow yeah and we need rightnow our mock template which is comingfrom our lib and mock uh yeah for nowfine and one more thing let's importquickly that our toast from our solarlibrary yeah now we can come back hereafter this use ages state let's add somemore use state hook for meta data andconfiguration model state. Okay, liketemplate set template is",
      "toast from our solarlibrary yeah now we can come back hereafter this use ages state let's add somemore use state hook for meta data andconfiguration model state. Okay, liketemplate set template is model open setis model open model node data and setmodel node data. Okay, and you can seethe initial value here is null uh null.This one is false and this one is nullas well. Yeah,now we're going to actually do some morework. Uh but for now let'scome back inside this div and let's addhere some styling. So we can actuallyadd here class name thatuh display flex and height full meanings100%. And we're going to add here onleft column right now. We can give herean comment that left column because thisis basically on full 100% and we have toadd here like left side and right sidecontent in this right side there will beon sidebird for our all notes andproperties. So let's make the leftcolumn now. So left column and it'sactually for header and canvas.Yeah. Now let's come back here. Let'sadd another",
      "side there will beon sidebird for our all notes andproperties. So let's make the leftcolumn now. So left column and it'sactually for header and canvas.Yeah. Now let's come back here. Let'sadd another div with class namesomething like this. Now inside herewe're going to actually add another divwith class name something like this.Now inside here let's add another divwith on H1 and paragraph something likethis that edit template and the templatename or slack then template description.So here you go. You can see design yourworkflow by connecting notes. It's justlike on fallback value because we don'thave any template or description. So wecan do one thing. We can actually justadd here in static text like thisbecause that's actually better thatdesign your workflow by connectingnotes. Yeah. And this is showing ourtemplate name that edit this template.Okay. Uh but one minute template dotname, right? So template is here. Uh settemplateset templateuh 1 minute. So we're doing here onsmall",
      "And this is showing ourtemplate name that edit this template.Okay. Uh but one minute template dotname, right? So template is here. Uh settemplateset templateuh 1 minute. So we're doing here onsmall mistakebecausewe have to add here an use effect hook.So use effect imported from react. Nowlet's add here an use effect snippet.inside hereconstant found template we can sayand we can look inside our mocktemplates we can use the find methodbecause this is an array so we need anobject or data of this like template sothat's why we're matching it with the tdot id and slag slag is coming fromwhere slag is coming from here our paramstart slack. Yeah. Now if there is nofound template,it means there is something wrong. Sothen just return the function. Yeah.Otherwise set template and foundtemplate. Yeah. Now after this we cansave it and we can actually add hereslack and we can save it. We can add theslack in this dependency array and wecan save it. Right now if we come backhere you will notice one",
      "Now after this we cansave it and we can actually add hereslack and we can save it. We can add theslack in this dependency array and wecan save it. Right now if we come backhere you will notice one interestingthing thatthis time it's showing Gmail ASMR anddiscord meanings it's actually addinghere our dynamic data and in here we cando one more thing right now since we dohave dynamic datalet's add our template dot descriptionsor this one yeah we can save it now andhere you go AI powered email sumsummarize send to your discord server.This is our template description.Yeah. So it's actually looking beautifulright now. Now after this what next?After this we have tocome back out from this div. Let'screate here another div. Uh it'sactually for something different. It'sfor our running state. But we can do onemore thing here.Let's do one thing. Let's add here aclass name called flex item center gapthree.Yeah. And for now, keep this div empty.Okay. Inside the div, just keep it emptybecause we're",
      "can do onemore thing here.Let's do one thing. Let's add here aclass name called flex item center gapthree.Yeah. And for now, keep this div empty.Okay. Inside the div, just keep it emptybecause we're going to add it later. Fornow, we don't need this. Yeah. For now,we don't need this. Now let's add themain thing here our canvas. So let's usehere card component from our components.The class name will be something likethis thatuh background color is like this. Bordercolor is like this. Flex one andposition relative. Now if we come backhere you can see it's already here butwe did a small mistake that's why it'sthere. Uh we have to cut thiscard right now and we have to add thisafter this 2D. Yeah. So the canvas willbe actually here uh or 1 minute. I thinkI'm again doing some mistake.So the card is here flex one here is 2Ddiv.I understand it. What we have to do?Just cut it. Since this is the wrapperdiv, we should add it here. Yeah, nowit's going to be in the perfect positionactually. Yeah,",
      "is here flex one here is 2Ddiv.I understand it. What we have to do?Just cut it. Since this is the wrapperdiv, we should add it here. Yeah, nowit's going to be in the perfect positionactually. Yeah, it's looking perfectnow. Now inside this canvas, I meaninside this curve, we have to add ourmain canvas. So let's add curt contentwith on small class name that P 0 andheight full. So h full. Now let's addhere another div with on reference thatreactflowwrapper. So very very important it'sactually on use ref. So we can come backhere. We can add on user ref for ourreact flow wrapper. It's going to be onHTML div element the type of this. Soit's like an common thing. We can justadd the type also since this is on divthat's why it's on HTML div element. Nowafter this react flow wrapper let's addhere class name that w sorry h full andw fullinside here let's add react flowand we have to add here actually a lotof thingslike nodes. So the nodes will be nodeswithuh running but at this momentwe can say",
      "name that w sorry h full andw fullinside here let's add react flowand we have to add here actually a lotof thingslike nodes. So the nodes will be nodeswithuh running but at this momentwe can say just nodes okay because wedon't have the nodes with running solet's make it just nodes yeah for now Iknow it's it's still going to do nothingbecause we have to work for that setnodes and we didn't do anything for thatand we're going to do that it's actuallya lot of work for React flow We have towrite lot of code actually and it'srequired for react flow because it's notan simple small library. It's huge. Ifwe go to the documentation of react flowyou will see how huge this library is.So when you're clicking this quick startyou can see the left side lot of thingshere that handles ages age levelsutility classes then uh like nodes themain important thing that's like you cansee this is actually nodes flow withcustom node so they have a lot of thingsthey have so many things here you cansee and react",
      "classes then uh like nodes themain important thing that's like you cansee this is actually nodes flow withcustom node so they have a lot of thingsthey have so many things here you cansee and react flow is on the mostbeautiful actuallydraggy drop drag and dropping uh librarywe can A almost lot of company use this.You can see they have so many designpatterns you can use and where you canalso use one today. They have so manyoptions here. Lot of options. Yeah.Let's come back here. Now after ageslet's add on nodechange and we're going to pass here ourhandlenodeschange function. It's not available yetand we have to create it. So let'screate it here now. Constant handle nodechange. Yeah. And it's going to be anuse call back function. Yeah, usecallback not function, it's called hookactually. Now changeswhich going to be any it's going toreceive this. Nowone node change it's going to pass thischanges and the set nodesnodes or nds then reindex steps number.Uh again the reindex step number is",
      "changeswhich going to be any it's going toreceive this. Nowone node change it's going to pass thischanges and the set nodesnodes or nds then reindex steps number.Uh again the reindex step number is notavailable here because it's actuallycoming from another hook which wehaven't created. So this is the problemof working with react flow. We have toset up everything at first otherwiselike you know during the work we willsee okay this one is not ready here.Okay. All right. So for now let'scomment it anduh we have to add here on dependencyarray since this is on hook. So in thisdependency array we have to add this onnode chainsset nodes and edges. Now let's do workfor the other most important file andit's going to be pretty big but we haveto create it and I will try to my bestto explain you this file. Okay, it'sgoing to be kind of complex because it'snot related with our this full project.It's actually for React Flow. We need todo lot of work for React Flow forconfiguring it perfectly",
      "this file. Okay, it'sgoing to be kind of complex because it'snot related with our this full project.It's actually for React Flow. We need todo lot of work for React Flow forconfiguring it perfectly because we'renot using just one small like you knowjust one small uh wrapper here, just onesmall canvas. No, we are using here somany features. So that's why we have toconfigure it properly. Now in thisdashboard filter uh folder not filterthis components folder and dashboardfolder let's create a new folderactually here.Yeah we can create it here. Let's sayworkflowsand inside this workflows filter let'screate a new folder by giving them flowutils and let's create an index.tsx tsxfile inside this. Yeah.Orwe could do one thing. Let me do onething. I'm I'm just making it overcomplicated. So flow utils it could bealso a file.So let me just cut itand it's should be a file in thisworkflows.So not tsx. This is going to be atypescript file. Yeah. Now let's startto work here. Uh at first let's",
      "utils it could bealso a file.So let me just cut itand it's should be a file in thisworkflows.So not tsx. This is going to be atypescript file. Yeah. Now let's startto work here. Uh at first let's makehere on interface for position. So whatis this position interface is doing?It's basically going to just a minute.Yeah. So it's basically on simplecoordinate type used by react flow toposition the nodes. Okay. Nodesmeanings. Let me show you again. Nodesmeanings. This one is node one. You cansee node one. node to this is node. Ifwe click here, this is one node. This isanother node. So we use this positionfor updating the positions of the nodes.Okay, that's why x-axis that's number,y-axis, that's also a number. Now weneed another important array here andthis is called icon map. Okay, it's notconnected with flow utils internally butwe need this and I'm explaining this.Why do we need this? So icon mapbasically centralize the icon selectionsfor nodes or pooling. Okay, the keysname like this web",
      "with flow utils internally butwe need this and I'm explaining this.Why do we need this? So icon mapbasically centralize the icon selectionsfor nodes or pooling. Okay, the keysname like this web mail or database.It's just matched by get icon for step.That's going to be another function.Okay, and the values are actual reactcomponent used to render icon in thecanvas. We're going to use this iconsinside our canvas. So let's import allof this icon from Lucid React. So I willjust quickly import it otherwise it willtake a lot of time. So let me justquickly import all of thisicon. Yeah something like this. Nowafter this after this icon map right nowthe next one is anotheruh function on styling function. Okayage style. So what this age styleactually does? So a style is sharedstyling for all ages in the workflowcanvas. Okay, this stroke it's just oncolor code which means this will show ongreen stroke because color code isactually green. That's why the strokewidth is two and stroke dash array",
      "in the workflowcanvas. Okay, this stroke it's just oncolor code which means this will show ongreen stroke because color code isactually green. That's why the strokewidth is two and stroke dash array isfive is to five. It means we're addinghere five by five. So that to likevisually indicate the flow without beingtoo heavy. Okay. If we make it two thenthat will be like more heavy. Yeah. Nownext oneuh actually next one is another functionfor our icon forcape. Okay. Which one Isaying here that icon forcape asexplaining in this icon map we need thisicon map inside this icon for get iconfor step function. So icon map we aresending here. I mean we're calling hereand then icon keys we this is this iconkeys is basically actually on array andwe're just finding out the key and ifit's matching then we're passing thefind found key otherwise arrow right. Soget icon for strip just tries to find anicon by scanning the step level. It'sreturn the first icon map key thatappears in the level or arrow",
      "we're passing thefind found key otherwise arrow right. Soget icon for strip just tries to find anicon by scanning the step level. It'sreturn the first icon map key thatappears in the level or arrow right ifnone matched like the by default value.Yeah. Now after thisuh we need another function. It's alsovery important. It's for getting ournote position. Okay. Now what is getnode position is doing? So get nodeposition decided where to place a notebased on its index. So first fourindices have fixed position for a cleantwo row layout. Okay. This first two.Yeah. Then remaining nodes fall back toa baseline like this uh y= like 280 with250 pixel horizontal sping spacing.Okay. Now this get node position isagain onjust on helper function for react flow.You don't need to like memorize all ofthese because it's just on smalllibrary. It's not any big thing. It'sjust the rules provided by the library.So that's why we are just adding all ofthat. Yeah. Now next function we needfor reindexing our step",
      "it's just on smalllibrary. It's not any big thing. It'sjust the rules provided by the library.So that's why we are just adding all ofthat. Yeah. Now next function we needfor reindexing our step numbers. It'svery important and it's going to beactually pretty big. So reindex stepnumbers and we need here age. Let'simport it from react flow. the type nodealso from react flow. Uh 1 minute node.Yeah.Okay. So no worries. We have to returnsomething then the error will be gone.Yeah. Let's come back here. Now at firstwe have tocheck is step. So what we are doing weare just treating the nodes with anumeric step number as a step nodes.Okay. Then we need our step nodesthat NDS do. And this is a step. Thennext one is id set. Okay, we are justmaking here on set with this step nodesdo map and this n dot id. I know itlooks little bit complicated. I meanbecause it's again it's connected withthat react canvas. That's why it'slooking little bit complicated. Notreact canvas react flow. Actually I",
      "n dot id. I know itlooks little bit complicated. I meanbecause it's again it's connected withthat react canvas. That's why it'slooking little bit complicated. Notreact canvas react flow. Actually I saidsomething wrong. However,uh right now we need another one forbuilding the incoming age counts andoutgoing adjacency for step nodes. Okay.So something like this that incomingcount and outgoingmapand now ID set just write on for eachloop incoming count set. Now at the endedssomething like this eds for each. So edscoming from where? EDS is this parametermeans age. So age for each we're justrunning here for each loop. If the IDset has this E dot target then incomingcount dot set send this E.Targetincoming count get E.target or bydefault zero + one. Okay, like somebasic mathematical things. You'll findout all of these even on this websitedocumentations. They have so many crazycrazy things. You can just read fromhere.They have lot of references. Yeah. Nowafter thisuh next one after this it's",
      "findout all of these even on this websitedocumentations. They have so many crazycrazy things. You can just read fromhere.They have lot of references. Yeah. Nowafter thisuh next one after this it's ending hereactuallywe need to choose the starting noderight we have to look for the startingnode the uh the first node so we can addhere something like this that ID set dotfindand incomingCount dot getID or by default zero if it's matchingwith zeroor step nodes dot sortA and A dot position dox minus Bdo.positionuh actually B.position.x X and the firstindex dot id. I know this is also kindof look like you know we are doing oncomplex math. This is start id but yeahthis is how we will get the start IDvalue. Here what we are doing we arelike adding here a node with zeroincoming edges. Okay. and the fallbackto the leftmost node by X position. Ifno clean start is found then okay I knowsometimes what I'm saying it's going upto your rate it can happens if you arebad at math like me yeah so chain",
      "fallbackto the leftmost node by X position. Ifno clean start is found then okay I knowsometimes what I'm saying it's going upto your rate it can happens if you arebad at math like me yeah so chain it'sgoing to array on stringand uh now let's add here anothervariable that let card sort which typewill be any and add this start ID nowconstant visitednew setstring and just call it. Yeah. Now let'sadd here while loop. So while cursor andvisited dot has doesn't have thiscursor.Then visited dot addthis cursor.And finally change dotpush this cursor.Now constant nextcandidateswe're going to add here outgoing map dotget cursoror an empty arraydot filterID that ID set dot has this ID the nextcandidates okay next notes, nextcandidate meanings.

Uh after this here NDSdot findinthen N dot id just match it with thisID.Yeah. Then finally we",
      "means it's not zero,it's not available, then break the loop.Okay.Now constant nextnext candidatesdot map. Uh after this here NDSdot findinthen N dot id just match it with thisID.Yeah. Then finally we have to sort italsothis part is looking weird level complexI know but again a.position.x minusb.positiondoxand just go to the first object do id orby default null. I mean if there is novalue then null like I guess fall backand thencursor will be nextor no let's come outside. Yeah and ourthispart is also done while part is alsodone.Nowwe have to add our remainingarray. Okay. So ID setdot builderid and chain dot includesID. So what is this? It's basically anorder any remaining nodes like not inthe primary change by position to keepthe visual layout consistent like sortinto sort times a c then y a c. I knowsounds weird again but this is theremaining uh node I guess. Yeah. Nowafter this we need our remaining order.Remaining order.So remaining dotmap definitely we are using a filter soit's",
      "y a c. I knowsounds weird again but this is theremaining uh node I guess. Yeah. Nowafter this we need our remaining order.Remaining order.So remaining dotmap definitely we are using a filter soit's going to return an array again. Somap idand nds dot map not map we have to findout right right now. So injust one par parameter then n dot idmatch it with this id. Yeah. Then againdo here on sortthat a b anda dotposition dot x if it's matching with bdot position dot xthen a dotdoty minus b do.position position doty.Otherwise, a do.position dot x minus bdot position dot x. Yeah, this is themath.And finally, let's add here another mapthat inand do id. So, this is the remainingordered.Now we have to create the final orderedlist and assign the steps numbers.Right? Now we have to create the finalorder list for our canvas. So finalorder let's spread the chain and theremaining ordered.Now ID to step it's going to be on newmap.It's going to return string or number.Thenfinal order dot for eachidxid",

So finalorder let's spread the chain and theremaining ordered.Now ID to step it's going to be on newmap.It's going to return string or number.Thenfinal order dot for eachidxid to step dot setid idx +1.

Okay so let's return it rightnow. So return nds dotuh mapinthen constant newstepsorry new stepand id to step dot get in dot idand again return is tapenand new stepand end dot data as anydot step number if it's not matchingwith new step then spreadthe n and for dataspread the n dot data Uhwith scapenumberwith this new scape. Yeah. Uh finallyone more thing we need to do that is thefinal fallbackthat n. Yeah that's it. We can save it.Right now you can see this function wasactually crazy big.this reindexed uh reindex step number.So it's basically when we are deletingon indexsuppose we are deleting",
      "n. Yeah that's it. We can save it.Right now you can see this function wasactually crazy big.this reindexed uh reindex step number.So it's basically when we are deletingon indexsuppose we are deleting on index fromherethen in our case here we in in in thisexample it's fine but in our case sincewe are tracking the index number we haveto track everything here when on indexis getting deleted for an example Ideleted the last one fine so we haveright now still 1 2 3 four index butsuppose I'm deleting the second indexthen what will happen this one will besecond. Right? So it's not easy how easywe're thinking to make. That's why weadded all of this code. Okay? We writeall of this code to just ensure it thatevery time anyone is deleting or addingany new notes, it just doesn't crash thesystem or it just like smartly handlethe work pressure. Yeah, that's it. Uhnow after this we need anotherfunction calledbuildinitial flow. Okay, this is like the bydefault initial flowwhich is going to",
      "or it just like smartly handlethe work pressure. Yeah, that's it. Uhnow after this we need anotherfunction calledbuildinitial flow. Okay, this is like the bydefault initial flowwhich is going to receivepound templateas any and configure stepslike this that record number andboolean. Now inside here what this buildinitial follow will do as I said earlierbuild initial follow just constructs aninitial react flow graph okay it's justcreating the by default react flowgraphs from a template list of steplevels it's also auto insert an open airmodel because we do have some like youknow here forour templates we are adding open in anew new like next line so That's why weare adding it like I mean auto insertingit properly. That's what I was saying.Yeah. Now inside herelet add let notesthen type will be node and array ofnode. Then found template dot stepsdot mapstep stringindexnumberand just call it. Yeah.

This is theicon dived by the level content. This isthe flex for first node because thefirst note we need to add on flag. Thenthis is the execution order and this isthe UI state so that we can show thatyeah the is this configured or not? Isthe note configured or not? Yeah.

Okay, that age style.Yeah.Now finally after this what we need nextwe need AI connection index differentone. Yeah. So AI connection index if thetemplate includes an AI generate stepthen insert and open AI model processingnote right after it. So it bumpsdownstream uh step numbers and rewritereward the ages. Yeah.Uh now here let me finish it.Let's add here onlike let's call the nodes herethennodes do map and sn like step numberhere we are saying the type of stepnumber is number then sn or likemore equals then insert in insert uhinsertion step then spread the n and indata just add this and step number isn't+ 1.

Yeah, but we have to finish thisright now. We don't have lot of codeleft. This is the AI node ID. And for AInode, we are doing this. When it's openAI model, then we are adding somethinglike this. The icon name is brain. Yeah.Nowuh after this one we have to remove thedirect edge between AI generate I meanwhen there is an AI generate then AIgenerate open AI model it's going to benext like top bottom not right side inthe canvas so let's just add that herequickly something like this so source IDand target ID this is the pages. You canjust see and read it. Then finally, wehave to return the notes and edges.That's it. Our this stupid flow utils.tsfunction or file is actually ready. Notfunction. We have so many functions herebecause this was just an helper functionor an utility function. Right? Now,we're",
      "it. Our this stupid flow utils.tsfunction or file is actually ready. Notfunction. We have so many functions herebecause this was just an helper functionor an utility function. Right?

So,we was inside this handle node change.Let's come back in this handle nodechange again.And in here, let's uncomment it. Let'sadd here reindex numbers. pass the NDSand ages. Yeah. Nowwe can save it and actually we need somemore function that drag start. So whenwe are dragging on like on note we needan function for executing that right. Soon drag start event data transfer setdata application/reactflowthis is provided by react flow. So weare just kind of like copy and pastingit that on drag and on. Okay.

So react flow instance isactually on state hook. So let's add ithere after this model open data. Yeah.But no errors and otherwise. Yeah.Otherwise everything done.Yeah. Let's come back here again. Linkages.Link ages. Link ages is actually onanother function we have to create inhere.So constant link ages it's going toreceive source id and new id. So whatthis link ages is doing so it'sbasically an helper function for rewarethe edges when inserting a node afterthe currently selected node. Yeah.

Now onconnect we're going to call our onconnecton connect function. So on connect isactually another function we have tocreate here after this on drop somethinglike this that it's also going to usecallback function an age id and we'repassing the set ages inside here. Sowhat it's doing it just adding a new agewhen two nodes are connected. Yeahthat's what it's doing.Uh then after this after one connectlet's pass here our on init oninitialize actually. So on init setreact flow instance then on droplet's call our onrop functionondrag over. We have to call here on dragover.So on drag over function we have tocreate it right now. On drag over it'salso going to be very small function.Let's create it here. Something likethis. Let's come back here. After thisone drag overwe need few more things that on nodeclickthen uh on double click on node",

Now these three functionsvery important. One note click it's onvery small function.Let's add it here. Something like this.And next one is on node double click. Soon nodedouble click which also going to besmallerfunctionlike this. So we're calling here openmodel. So it's basically onanother small two function. Okay thatopen model and close model. We are justcalling that set open uh model nodedata. We're passing the node data andset is model true open and close modelbeing just it's just doing the oppositework.

Yeah. Or uheither we can do one more thing. Let'sdo actually one thing on shortcutthat data and is connectable. Yeah,something different.

Ifit has any error then add on red border.If it's running then add on green borderotherwise by default black border andhover just on green border. Yeah. Uhthen if it has any error then we justhave to show on warning that there issomething actually wrong in the nodeexecutions or the workflow executions.It's giving error because at the endwe have toexport this node typeslike this that custom custom node.

Okay. Now,um let me do one thing. Let me quicklyat the right side at least the rightside divid so that it doesn't take thisfull space. Okay? Because it it will nottake the full space. After this card anddiv, let's add the right side div withclass name W Aborder Lbordersomething like this. the color codethen overflowoiauto.

I found the problem why it's notworking and it's actually silly mistakewe have done and the mistake is try tounderstand what is not loading here ournodes and ages are not loading hereright so it means that we forgot to setthe nodes and edges somewhere and yeahwe are right after this set template inthis 200 to 205 number line you can seetemplate we are setting the template oninitial load very good but we are notsetting here our nodes and ages. Solet's take back nodes and ages frombuild initial follow from our this flowutils and we have to pass here the foundtemplate and configure step.So configuresteps. Now you might be thinking fromwhere the configure steps is coming it'sactually on state hook. So no worrieslet's create it",

So letme just quickly add that that userconnections and connection loading andset connection loadings. Yeah. Let'scome back here right now again and we'resending here configure steps.Yeah. So I added here wrong spelling. Itshould be configured steps. Yeah.Perfect. Uh now after this what next?From here we are right now receiving.From here we are receiving nodesand ages.And we can just change this nodes nameto initial nodes and ages toinitialages. Yeah. Now after this we can sayset nodes and we can pass this initialnodes uh nodes actually. So initialnodesthis one uh no we cannot pass like this.Let's do one thing. Let's call ourreindex step numbers.

You can see wehave our all nodes here. right now thatGmail AI generate open AI model anddiscord. If we do delete here when I'mjust pressing my delete icon I mean uhdelete from my keyboard you can see it'sdeleting the notes we can move the notesor we can do whatever we want here.

So forconfiguration model we have to create anew function or an component called nodeconfiguration model. You can give thisname to anything butlike there should be somelike similarities with the name rightthat's why I'm just adding here nodeconfiguration model let's go back to ourdashboard and workflows folder in thiscomponents folder let's addconfigurationuh sorry nodeconfigurationandmodel.tsx.Yeah.RFCnode configuration model. We can saveit. We can import it. Done. Now in thisnode configuration model it's going toreceivefew parameters few very importantparameterslike each openon closeand node data and onconfigured.Yeah, let's uh add here onsimple",
      "it. Done. Now in thisnode configuration model it's going toreceivefew parameters few very importantparameterslike each openon closeand node data and onconfigured.Yeah, let's uh add here onsimple interfacethat node configuration model propssomethinglike this. Yeah. So we are basicallyadding here so many things and by theway we need more to interface. Let mequickly add that one is forour node dataand another in another one is forconnections. Yeah. So connections andthis node data you can see the uhinterface values like the data structurelevel descriptions icon register nodestep number. So it's basically similarlike this lowsuh interfaces we are kind of like youknow uh configuring the nodes right now.Yeah. Uh after this here we can receiveor we can say that uh it's going to beourI mean the type is going to benode configuration model props. Yeah.Now let's come insidelet's say constant connectionsconnections and setconnectionsuse stateit's going to give an empty array andtype will be",
      "the type is going to benode configuration model props. Yeah.Now let's come insidelet's say constant connectionsconnections and setconnectionsuse stateit's going to give an empty array andtype will be connections and array ofconnections. Yeah.Then we need some more state likeloadingset loadingthen selected connections and setselected connections API key set API keyand API endpointset API endpoint and some another statelike cool configand finally we need one very importantfunction for our nodes. display namebecause we're not going to show themexactly like this because when the nameis Stripe then we're going to capitalizeit. When it's Gmail we're going to showlike this. When its we're going to showGoogle sheets, open AAI like this.Gemini like this clot like this webbooktrigger webbook trigger. So it's notjust capitalizing it's like a differentuh word a different word or differentsentence we can say. That's why we arecreating here different function fordisplay name. Yeah. So it's just",
      "So it's notjust capitalizing it's like a differentuh word a different word or differentsentence we can say. That's why we arecreating here different function fordisplay name. Yeah. So it's just onhelper function. Then secondly we needour icon component. It's very veryimportant which icon we're going to use.So icon component we need our icon mapimported from flow utils and arrow rightimported from lucid react. Now we needsome quick uh function not functionvariable something like this thatplatform name andwe need here get platform name and o isoath provider and is API key provider iscore provider. So we need this functionsand we're going to create that rightnow. It's going to be small smallfunctions but very very importantbecause we are right now dividing ourproviders. So first of all our oathproviders it's going to be on area oflist like stripe, Gmail, slack, discord,notion, sheets all of them needs oathconnection. So oath providers next oneis API key providers. So API keyproviders",
      "oathproviders it's going to be on area oflist like stripe, Gmail, slack, discord,notion, sheets all of them needs oathconnection. So oath providers next oneis API key providers. So API keyproviders like this OpenAI, Gemini andCL then core providers which isdifferent one. So core providers meaningsomething like this that web trigger orschedule trigger a generate conditionloop delay. So we actually don't havethis condition and loop anymore. So wecan delete that and delay and generateall of them. We do have those features.Yeah. Now get platform name. Uh 1 minutewhere we are adding it. So we aresorry we actually need one more functionhere. Get platform name. Get displayname. This is sookay. Platform name is display name isdifferent.Hm. Kind of different becausewhen we're using platform name, we aremaking it similar to match our corefunctionalities. Okay. Since we do haveso many providers, so it's very hard andit's mandatory for us to use the sameword everywhere. That's why we are",
      "name, we aremaking it similar to match our corefunctionalities. Okay. Since we do haveso many providers, so it's very hard andit's mandatory for us to use the sameword everywhere. That's why we are doingthis that lower doinccludes Gmail thenreturn Gmail slack like this you can seeweb trigger then web trigger schedulethen schedule trigger HTTP then HTTPrequest. So it's just like on structurewe are basically following in this fullapplication. Uh here we need some UXhelpers just for styling purpose.Something like this that input class.You can read it againand field. Yeah. Nowthat important one that uhactually is oath provider or not. Sosince right now we do have ourour that one minute let me explain thisfirst to you. Let me write this first.Since right now we do have this oproviders and API key providers we caneasily make these functions that is oproviders or is code provider or is APIkey provider by just like checking thearray. Since this is an array, we canuse this includes method and",
      "key providers we caneasily make these functions that is oproviders or is code provider or is APIkey provider by just like checking thearray. Since this is an array, we canuse this includes method and we can lookfrom this parameters. Okay, that's it.And it sounds really easy and it reallylooks also easy. I think you'reunderstanding it. If not, then I meanjust rewatch the code a little bit thenyou will understand it easily or evenyou can ask Chpt to explain it in a morebetter way if you are still notunderstanding it. But I think you shouldunderstand it. If you understood thispart, I mean this flow utils, thiscomplex file, then you should definitelyunderstand this node configurationsmodel because it's easy compared to thisflow utils. Uh nowafter the display name, what next? Wehave to right now load the savedconnections, but we don't have the APIyet. So we are we're going to just skipit for now. I mean we're going to do itlater. And on safety boil out ofrendering after hooks run. So we",
      "now load the savedconnections, but we don't have the APIyet. So we are we're going to just skipit for now. I mean we're going to do itlater. And on safety boil out ofrendering after hooks run. So we arejust adding here this that if is open isfalse or if no data is false then returnnull. Now uh we need on small functionthat handle save.This is for saving the configuration.Okay. Configuration means this noteconfiguration.Yeah. Nowlet's keep it empty for now. For now wedon't need anything. Uh let's come backout and let's add here another smallfunctionlike this that handle o connect. Yeah.Now uh after thisherelet's do one thing. Let's add hererender core configuration functionandlet's use here on switch catchstatement. So switch if the switch isthis platform namethen case will bewaytrigger. Yeah.Then returnuh for now just keep it static. So letmeadd here small div with class names likethis. For now this is just on static.Okay, we're going to make it dynamiclater. Now if the case islet's",
      "Yeah.Then returnuh for now just keep it static. So letmeadd here small div with class names likethis. For now this is just on static.Okay, we're going to make it dynamiclater. Now if the case islet's come here. If the case isschedule triggerthen what? Then we have to return heresomething different a more different divwhere like user will be able to selectmultiple schedule trigger like it can beon field that interval or chromeexpressions. What uh is the type of yourschedule? Do you want to schedule aninterval or uncone expression? Next oneis if the core config.C schedule type ischromethen1 minute.Yeah. So if the core configs scheduletype is chrome when you are selectingchrome from here then chrome expressionsand we're providing here placeholdersthat you can add the chrome that chrometime job. Okay, I mean that times herethis is like some like example in theplaceholder that after how many minutesor how many seconds or how many hoursyou want to run this chrome job for thisworkflow. Yeah.",
      "Okay, I mean that times herethis is like some like example in theplaceholder that after how many minutesor how many seconds or how many hoursyou want to run this chrome job for thisworkflow. Yeah. Now if it's not thenwhat next? Definitely this is oninterval that after a certain time orafter a minute you want to run this.Yeah, that's it. That's why we're addinghere another field with this input H.Now let's come out from here. Let's addhere another case. If it's HTTPrequestthen returnanother divwith that same class name that space Y3add here on fieldand we're saying this time that selectclass okay field level is HTTP method.So you right now we're giving options tothe user that you can select get, post,put, delete or patch any request. I meanthe type of the request for the HTTPmethod. And then later on what next?Definitely the user has to add the theuser this time we're going to offer themor we're going to give them options toadd the API URL.Yeah. Nowif the case is send",
      "And then later on what next?Definitely the user has to add the theuser this time we're going to offer themor we're going to give them options toadd the API URL.Yeah. Nowif the case is send notificationthenlet's return something different thistime.So for send notification we have someproviders right. It can be email it canbe Slack or it can be Discord. So let'sadd that field in here that notificationchannel and on select option that emailslack or discord. After selecting thatwe will ask for the message templatelike anything extra you want to add thenyou can add that and that's it. Nowafter this after this one let's add caseAIgeneratewe can return here new div with classname space Y3we can add here on field with level thatAI provider if it's AI generate then andfield actually we need to add hereselectthat select AI providers from here. Itcan be open, it can be cloud or it canbe Gemini.Uh after this field when you areselecting on provider you have to add onprompt right on prompt template",
      "hereselectthat select AI providers from here. Itcan be open, it can be cloud or it canbe Gemini.Uh after this field when you areselecting on provider you have to add onprompt right on prompt template or likeany prompt your AI prompt template it'sdefinitely going to be optional you canadd it or even you can skip it. Then thelast one is condition. So let's comeback here again when the case isconditionthen returnanother divby saying something like this thatuh condition expressions. Actually wedon't need this conditions. So don'tdon't add it. Okay. Because we deletedit already. So we we're not going to addit. just going to waste our code. Imean, we're doing hard work for nothing.So, we don't need that condition. Uh, weneed the delay. So, delay, actually, Idon't think we need the delaybecause delay it's already in that. No,no, no. Delay is different. Delay is nota crone job. Delay is that like you knowin this specific portion or in this likespecific nodes you want to do on delay.Yeah. So",
      "delay it's already in that. No,no, no. Delay is different. Delay is nota crone job. Delay is that like you knowin this specific portion or in this likespecific nodes you want to do on delay.Yeah. So it's different. So if the caseis delay then we're going to add thisdiv with this same class name and fieldand this it's going to be a number thathow much delay you want to do for thisspecific notes. How many seconds it canbe milliseconds it can be seconds. Itcan be hours or even it can be like uhhours. So we actually should not offerhours because then it's going to bedifferent thing. We can offer hereminutes only minutes, seconds andmilliseconds. Yeah. Because sometime itcan happens that you want to do somedelay. Yeah. And let's delete the break.And in this defaultby default let's add here on returnby saying something like this that thedisplay name node is ready to use noadditional configured required. Yeah andwe don't need even just break we don'tneed to break this switch",
      "add here on returnby saying something like this that thedisplay name node is ready to use noadditional configured required. Yeah andwe don't need even just break we don'tneed to break this switch sketchstatement.Yeah that's it. Nowanother important thing that savedisabledwhen you're not adding anything in theinput then in that required input thenwe will not let you save thedata. So API key dot trimso that you cannot add any empty spaceand platform nameif it'sHTTPrequestand core configdot URL. Let's come in this return.Let's add here ondiv with class name that fixed insidezero uh backdrop blur SM and rest. Youcan just read it by yourself. Uh okay.Nowinside here let's add another divkind of similar. We are just adding onmodel type of thing here. You can justread it and you can understand it bywatching the class names. Yeah. Now weneed on header an icon level. So we canadd here our model headerthat nodelevel node data level and this is thediv starting from here. You can just seeit",
      "it bywatching the class names. Yeah. Now weneed on header an icon level. So we canadd here our model headerthat nodelevel node data level and this is thediv starting from here. You can just seeit carefully. I'm slowly moving myscreens.Yeah. So what it's doing? It's doingnothing. It's just adding on level andcross icon. By the way, let's come backhere. Let's pass all the fields fromhere.So let's send unconfiguredwhich going to be uh mark stepconfigured or for now step configuredum or just a minute markstep configured uh actually we needanother function for this it's importantyeah it's important because we have tomake the step that yeah mark that thisstep is done. This step setup is done.So let's create a new function by givingname mark step configured.It's going to be on use call back. It'sgoing to receive state number whichgoing to be numberconfig which going to be anyinside hereset nodesand brave dotmapconstant SNnumberthen n dot dataas anystep number. Yeah. If step number thissn is",

If step number thissn is matching with this step numberthen returnthe n and datathat ndotdataas anyis configured will Okay.True.And config will beconfigand n dot data asnthen config.If not available then null just anfallback value.And finallyreturn innowadd here on dependency array and it'sgoing to be actually empty dependencyarray. Let's save it. We did lot of workright now. We're going to see theresult. So when I'm hitting Gmail youcan see Gmail open a model. Open a modeldiscord. this code AI generate AIgenerate and it's looking actuallyperfect. Let's come back here again andlet's finish this important uh functionor important component. Now after thisdiv, let's come inside this our mainmodel body. So let's add on simple basicclass name that is space Y4when the loading is true.ThenDIV class name flexitem centerjustify",
      "component. Now after thisdiv, let's come inside this our mainmodel body.

This is justan iconclass name will beW4 H4and MR2.Yeah, we can save it. you will seenothing yet. Why? Because we haven'tconnected any providers yet. So afterthis settings, let's say connecteddisplay nameaccounts. You'll just see here on simplemessage that connected Gmail accountsbut you will see empty. Why? Again wehaven't connect any Gmail yet because wehaven't set up even that providersproperly. We will do that after thisafter finishing the UI. Uh JV class",

Yeah. So that I can format thecode and the code will be more optimizedand you can read it care clearly. Uh letme add here another divwith class name like this that flex itemcenter and justify",
      "Yeah. So that I can format thecode and the code will be more optimizedand you can read it care clearly.

Then let'sadd here another div withon paragraph that connections accountname connected on this date and thenwhen the selected connections andconnection ID is matchingthen we can add here check circle iconfrom lucid reactand finally here in this else partlet's add here on ifwithclass name like this. And let's add hereon paragraphthatuh no connected accounts found for thisdisplay name. Yeah, that's it. Let's addhere another divafter this.

Nowat the endafter this two div, let's go outsidefrom here. If it's API key,then what? This was good forlike social media connections we cansay. I mean not social media integrationlink like Discord, Gmail or even Slack.But what's about AI generated? It'sempty. What's about open AI model?Empty. So let's work for it because it'snot going to be same as like Gmailsheets, I mean Google sheets or discord.That's why. So when it's API key, let'sadd another DIV with class name spaceY3on H3 with class name text SMfont mediumtext gray 300 display flex item center.Let's import key icon from Lucid React.Class name W4H4M are going to be two.

Now if not if the user doesn'thave any configured or saved API keys wehave to offer him for adding a new APIkey. So API key type is password. Thisis the value. This is the placeholder.Now after this API key endpoint uh wecan actually skip the endpoint. We don'tneed endpoint. So for now this so we cansave it now. Now after this uh field divuh here we can come out because for APIkey also doneone minute API key or what was thatum API key or sorry AI generate or",

If it'score core meanings if it's this HTTPrequest then let's delete this code. AddHTTP request.Let's add it here.Not done right. So let's work for thecode part. So if it's corethenlet's add on small div and let's callour that render core configurationfunction which one we created some timeago. Yeah that's it. Now after all ofthese div actually this one we can addour footer.Yeah. And the footer is going to havejust two buttonsomething like this that cancel and saveconfiguration. So cancel or saveconfiguration. Same here cancel or saveconfigurations. Cancel after doing onhover the text color should be white. Sotext white.Yeah. Done. That's it. Everything isactually done.

If you notice here,you can see here's 1 G, but we need here2 G. So, schedule trigger the spellingwas actually wrong otherwise everythingwas correct. But right now, you can seeit's actually breaking. So we can addhere interval or chrome expression youcan give here like you know any valueanything like after a certain time youwant to run this you want to run thefour step yeah that's it now what nextsince all of this right now done we havetoset up this all oath providers like whenwe're",

We have to store that likeyou know that access can refresh toaccess access token and refresh token inour database. But why? Because otherwisenext time when the workflow is beingexecuted, we need those access token andrefresh token to communicate with theseproviders. Okay, that's why we need thatand we can easily do that. Let me showyou how can we do that. We cannotexactly like store the raw access tokenand refresh token inside our databasebecause that's not any secure approach.User is not going to do that. I mean ifthe user is like you know understandabout any coding a little bit understandabout security a little",
      "inside our databasebecause that's not any secure approach.User is not going to do that.

I mean I am goingto take access to your access key andrefresh key refresh token and I can dowhatever I want by using your Gmail.Definitely you don't want me to getaccess inside your Gmail like that.That's why we're going to actuallyencryptuh access token and refresh token. We'regoing to encrypt this access token andrefresh token. So that even the adminalso cannot access it. Only the platformonly the platform means this providerwill have the access and our databasewill our application will store that inan encrypted way so that no one canaccess the access token and refreshtoken and no one can access thisplatform without this like without usingthis workflow. Yeah, that's it. Rightnow, at first we have to design ourdatabase. Why we we have to do it",
      "token and refreshtoken and no one can access thisplatform without this like without usingthis workflow. Yeah, that's it. Rightnow, at first we have to design ourdatabase. Why we we have to do it first?Because at first, let's make an properplan which fields and which things weactually need in our connections tablebecause we're going to add here a newtable called connections where we'regoing to store all of these connections.Suppose you are storing your or you'reconnecting your Gmail account here. Sowe're going to store that in thisdatabasein this database right. So we needconnections table for that. So let'screate our connection tables. Exportconstant connections pg table importedfrom uh drizzlem/postrsqlcode. Now here the table name is goingto be connections. Yeah. Now here let'sadd an id which is going to be an uu idand u ID import imported from againuh result and pz core. Now u idID and primary key this is the type thisis the type of ID. Yeah.

Okay, whichis uh optimized for faster processingand searching and indexing compared tothat standard text base JSON. So JSONand JSON B it's just a binaryrepresentation we can say the binaryform. uh after this after meta data weneed the most important thing is thataccess token means encrypted accesstoken it's going to be byanduh we actually need another custom bytetype for binary data okay since this isan encrypted data that's why we needthis now constant byta let's create afunctionadd here on customtype from PC core and here it's going touh receive datawhich going to be buffernot nullwhich going to be falseand default faultwhich going to be false as well.

      "So, we can close this Griselconfig and we can even close thisschema.ts for now. We don't need thatfile anymore for now. Uh, now let's setup the oath workflow. And the oath iskind of going to be a little bitcomplicated. Why? Let me explain.Because we're having here so manyproviders like Gmail, Slack, Discord,notions, Google Sheets, a lot ofproviders. And to be honest, it's themost challenging part, you know, thisapplication to connect all of theseplatforms because Gmail and Discord,they're not same. The parent company isnot same. So definitely they have theirinternal connecting mechanism. So whenwe are connecting Discord, we have touse a different code. For Gmail, we haveto use different code. For Stripe,different code for notion, differentcode. That's the most challenging partin this application.But for solving this problem, I actuallytried my best to solve this problem. Andthat's why we created here a new folderin this li folder by giving name o. Andinside here we're going to add all",
      "for solving this problem, I actuallytried my best to solve this problem. Andthat's why we created here a new folderin this li folder by giving name o. Andinside here we're going to add all ofthe providers configuration. Soproviders.ts.Hereit's kind of going to be bigger but letme show you one by one. You have to justcopy paste everything. Okay. what I'mdoing first for Gmail.For Gmail, what we need? We need Gmailuh Google client ID and Google clientsecret. So, we're getting that fromprocess.vuh like Google client ID and Googleclient secret. We're going to add thatlater. Now, scope very very importantarray. So in scope you have to addpermissions like which permissions weneed from the users. We need Gmailpermission like readonly permission. Weneed Gmail send permission even we needmodify permission. You might be thinkingwhy do we need modify permission. Justthink about it. You you are automatingyour Gmail workflow. You're just likesummarizing an email and you're sendingit to a discorder",
      "You might be thinkingwhy do we need modify permission. Justthink about it. You you are automatingyour Gmail workflow. You're just likesummarizing an email and you're sendingit to a discorder somewhere or likeinside any uh HTTP endpoint. But afterlike summarizing it, after checking it,you have to make it mark as read, right?So for making that mark as read, we needthis Gmail modify permission and that'swhy we're adding that in here. Yeah. Nowafter this, we need our authorized URL.Very very important. It's required byGoogle. Then uh access URL anotherimportant thing. And finally, we needour call back URL which going to be likethis because we're going to make ourendpoint like this. Okay, that's whyit's going to be like this. We're goingto create here on oath folder in thisAPI and Gmail and call back like that.Yeah. Uh that's it for Gmail. It's done.We can connect our Gmail account withthis configuration. Now, next one issheets meanings Google sheets. So Googlesheet is also similar since",
      "back like that.Yeah. Uh that's it for Gmail. It's done.We can connect our Gmail account withthis configuration. Now, next one issheets meanings Google sheets. So Googlesheet is also similar since the parentcompany is same that's why sheets and inkey we can use that same Google clientID and Google client secret for scope itwill be little bit different becausewe're right now getting permission orasking permissions for Google sheet orspreadsheets that's why we have to askpermission like this this is authorizedURL access URL and then call back URLthis time instead of uh Gmail this willsheets. Yeah. Now, next one is Slack.So, for Slack, it's going to be actuallydifferent.You can see the Slack also require keyand secret as like Google. Fine. Butscope is different. It's not any URL.This time we're just like asking for thechat right or chat rate or user streetor incoming web hook access. AuthorizeURL this one. Access URL this one andcall back this one. Yeah. After slack weneed access for",
      "we're just like asking for thechat right or chat rate or user streetor incoming web hook access. AuthorizeURL this one. Access URL this one andcall back this one. Yeah. After slack weneed access for discord. So for discordit's also a little bit different. Youcan see discord client ID discord clientsecret and scope is identify guides andweb hook incoming and authorized URLlike this. Access URL like this and callback like this. Okay. After discord whatnext? Next is notion and stripe.So let me quickly add both of them. Sonotion first notion client ID notionclient secret we're asking for databaseread write pages right and pages readpermission and authorize URL access URLyou can again check it be make sure thatyou are adding the same line otherwiseit will might not work for youperfectly.

It's even",

It's even easy to workwith Gmail API and sheets API. But restof them like Slack, Discord, notion,it's just like hilarious. They don'twork with like local host. you must haveto use on applications like on you knowwe have so many libraries like ngrock ofthem let me show you something like thison API gateway uh not this one but Imean we can run our local host into likeon uh we can say on what's what is thatwhat's that name on I forgot the name sowe can actually run this local host 3000and this dashboard port and this insteadof local host it will run on inside onstatic or not static it's going to runon random domain okay random domainprovided by nro why do we need thatbecause these platforms like u notion orstripe stripe even also uh doesn't workwith local host we must need onhttps URL okay and we can",

Noworries. For now, we're not connectingit. We're connecting Google and otherplatforms. But definitely we'll connectall of these one by one. Yes, we cansave it now. And finally, here we canadd here just one simple type that asconst. Yeah, we can save it now.And our provider setup is done. It waskind of important, kind of complex. Youmight be thinking it's easy but to behonest it's not that much easy. How mucheasier you're thinking? I mean writingit fine but when we're working with thismultiple multiple uh platforms multiplemultiple providers it's really hard towork with them because all of them don'thave the similar pattern of work workingor similar pattern of connecting. Yeah.Now uh we have to create a new folder",
      "providers it's really hard towork with them because all of them don'thave the similar pattern of work workingor similar pattern of connecting.

So o yeahin this oath folder let's create uh ouranother folder that dynamicprovider because the provider can beanything it can be Gmail it can besheets it can be stripe notions ordiscord or anything now inside here weneedtwo more routes on this call back youcan see API so API Okay.

Now uh one importantthing very important thing we have tomake sure that there isaccess token in thetoken response. Okay. So when there isaccess token in the token responseuh sorry not token response I'm sorry itshould be in tokens. Yeah so in tokenswhen there is access uh token then noaccess token actually you can say nohere. So then we can say noaccess token in theresponseand we can pass the tokenswe have to give here a comma. Yeahthat's it. And finally when there is noaccess token uh in that tokens we canactually send on response that no tokenuh no access token received. Yeah. Thenthis time we're going to use our thatfunction that derived account name.Okay. From where",
      "token uh in that tokens we canactually send on response that no tokenuh no access token received. Yeah. Thenthis time we're going to use our thatfunction that derived account name.Okay.

Now let's addhere on try catch statementin tripart constant configwhich going to be anynow providers config provider as key ofand type of provider configs. Yeah. Nowif there is no configthen we can just add on console warningthis time that no configuration foundfor the provider and this is theconnected account user info null.

Finally, we canreturn this function withaccount namelike connected accountand user infowhich going to be null. Yeah, we cansave it. We can come back here in thisfunction where we were breaking. Nowafter thisuh after getting our account info uhaccount name and user info what we haveto do now we have to encrypt the tokens.The encrypt function returns actually uhlet me let me do one thing. Let's writehere constantencryptedaccess token. Yeah, we're going to usehere on the function called encrypt andwe have to create it because encrypt isgoing to be our internal encryptionsfunction.

Let'sgo to in this utils folder. Where is ourutils folder?Ah there is no utils folderthen no worries.We can create a new folder by givingthem utils. And let's add hereencrypt. Yes. Yeah. So, we're going towrite here our encryption logic. Andwe're going to use crypto library for uhmaking the encryption. And you don'thave to install this crypto librarybecause it's an built-in module inNodeJS. Yeah, we're going to use here analgorithm. The algorithm is AES256GCM. This the algorithm name. Theencrypted keyhere the encrypted key must need to be32 bytes. Okay, for generating we canuse this command that open SSL randomand this hex is actually on flag. Okay,flag meanings like we are saying we arein giving instruction to this open SSLthat please generate this value with anhexa decimal format. Okay, if you haveknowledge",

We can just copy thisand we can come back in our envionkey. Sotokenc and key and let's paste the value inhere. Yeah. So we make sure that we areadding the same spelling.Cool. Now after thiswhat next? We have to add here an IVlength which is going to be 16. Yeah.Now let's create our main encryptfunction. So export function encrypt itjust going to receive one text whichwill be string. Now constant IV let'scall it crypto dot random bytes passthis IV lennow constant cipherwe can call crypto dot create cipherhivesorry cipher ivy sorry sorry sorry sorryfor the wrong pronunciations and we haveto pass the algorithm encrypted key andthe ivyYeah.

So actually [clears throat]done. Uh now we can import encryptsince our encrypt is ready and we haveto pass the tokens dotaccess tokenand we have to also do the same thingfor ourencrypted refresh token. Right? So we'regoing to pass the token refresh tokenand then we're going to pass it in thisencrypt functionthat refresh tokenand finally we have to pass the IV.

Now wehave to check the existing connections.Okay. It's very important because we arechecking if the platform is alreadyconnected with our like provider if ifit's already in the database or not. Sofor an example from here you havealready connected your own Gmail accountand you're again trying to connectingit. So definitely we cannot store it fortwice. So it's just on like protectionlayer we can say. So we are using hereDB because we're checking it from ourdatabase. So connectionsand import it from DLERM EQ same DLM.Yeah. So what we're doingwe are selecting this connections tableand inside here where the connections douser id is matching with the session douser ID and connection.platform platformis matching with this providerconnection account name because this isgoing to be unique.

So then we will notlet the user to connect it again becausethe user already connected it and whenthe connections length is more than zeroit meaningsthere is something wrong. So we willactually update our database. We willnot tell the user that hey you cannotconnect it. We'll just basically updateour configurations. I mean update oursaved encrypted data. Okay that's howwe're making the updated data objecthere. The new access token encryption.Um then buffer from encrypted accesstoken IV metadata and updated. Thenwe are going to override it. If therefresh tokenlike the refresh token Google return oneif it's then okay so if the encryptedrefresh token is matching with ourencrypted refresh token then the formatuh",

Yeah.So yeah, elsethis was if else logic. You can see thisis this was if right now let's come backin else we have to insert data. Why?Because the userhaven't stored any data yet. That's whywe are inserting the data right now.Okay. It's the new fresh data. It's likethe usually the user will do. I mean noone definitely don't want to store theiraccount for twice when when they arewatching that they already connectedtheir account and that's already inhere. They're not going to again connectthat like that's a common sense. So forthat type of users like normal userswe're having",
      "that they already connectedtheir account and that's already inhere. They're not going to again connectthat like that's a common sense. So forthat type of users like normal userswe're having this else statement. Thenwe're just inserting the data. We areadding that user ID, platform, accountname, access token encrypted encryptedone and refresh token encryption one.Yeah. And IV and metadata.Yeah. And finally we have to redirectback the user to the original page.So we are currently redirecting the userto dashboardand we areactually passing the user like this.Okay. So redirect URL then redirect yourincludes if it includes anything likethis then and and connected provider. Sowe are sending the in the same page tothe user after connecting the platform.Yeah. If it's catch any error thenconsole error that o call back error andsend the error and just an internalserver error and that's it. So this wasthe file. It was kind of big. Not kindof big. It was crazy big I would saybecause we did so many",

It was crazy big I would saybecause we did so many things and it wasrequired actually. We had no othersolutions. We had no other optionsactually. But finally it's done and I'mhappy to see that it's done right now.What next? Since this callback is done,we need another route for starting butthis is not going to be big but we haveto create it in this start one. So startroute API route. Let's create it. It'sgoing to be on get endpoint. Sosomething like this thatuh export async function get request isgoing to be next request and params isgoing to be similar like this call backone.

Yeah. Nowafter this uh here actually we'relooking for return URL. Now uh we haveto make one object here that state data.We need id and return URL. We need statesomething like this.Andafter this we need app URL uh sorry OURL and app URL.So O URL and app URL. O URL is going tobe this configuration dot authorize URLand app URL is going to be the publicapp URL or by default this one likefallback value andO URL dot search params get the clientID redirect URI and response type and ifthe scopeif the scope in this configurations andconfiguration scope is matching Thenscope string we are checking it.

Thisfunction is almost ending. Uh if theprovider is Gmail or provider is sheetsthen we need this. Okay. Otherwise wedon't need anything else for otherproviders and O URL search params setfor other providers just add the state.Yeah. And finally we canreturn thenext response with this o url dot tostring. We are basically storing thestate and provider in a shortliftcookie. Okay, we're doing that with thisnext response direct.That's it. Uh our this API route work isalso done.Now what next?

And in credentialswhat you have to do you have to clickthis create credentials you have toclick O client ID and in O client IDapplication type will be webapplications you can add yourapplication nameauthorized JavaScript origins it's goingto be our local host origin. So let meshow you practically what is the flow xvalues. So this is the",
      "will be webapplications you can add yourapplication nameauthorized JavaScript origins it's goingto be our local host origin. So let meshow you practically what is the flow xvalues. So this is the authorizedjavascript origin. This is the redirectURI. So for Gmail, we have to add likethis. For sheets, we have to add likethis. This is the client ID. This is theclient secret. I'm not showing my clientsecret to you for security reason. Butafter like you know creating an accounton oath account like this you will haveyour own client ID client secret. Youjust have to copy paste that. Yeah. Sothis is going to be the redirect URI.And one more thing be make sure that youare searching for Gmail from here. GmailAPIand you are enabling it. It's actuallyrequired for getting access to Gmail.It's mandatory. I don't know why it'snot coming. Yeah, here it is. So, youmust have to enable this Gmail API.Okay. Otherwise, it will not work.That's it. I assume that you have yourown Google client ID and client",
      "I don't know why it'snot coming. Yeah, here it is. So, youmust have to enable this Gmail API.Okay. Otherwise, it will not work.That's it. I assume that you have yourown Google client ID and client secretright now. So, let me go back here againand let me add my Google client ID andclient secret. Don't try to copy pastemy Google client ID and client secretbecause it's it's not going to work foryou. After creating the video, I willdefinitely delete it. So this is the GLGoogle client ID which is public. Fine.Client secret is this one. But don't useit. Use your own Google client andclient secret because I'm going todelete it. And why I'm saying it formultiple time because last time in oneof my another project it was that uh carbooking app I guess I mistakenlylike I was showing my Google client IDand Google client secret and I forgot todelete that and then I realized that Ilike I got email actually from from uhGoogle cloud that I have to pay $55 toGoogle because I'm using their lot ofAPIs",

It's like a common thing. Yeah.So that's it. I'm I'm going to just saveit and I'm just coming back here again.Um now what next?We do have access in Google. So let'sconnect it right now. perfectly forconnecting Google.Uh at first let's",
      "it. I'm I'm going to just saveit and I'm just coming back here again.Um now what next?We do have access in Google. So let'sconnect it right now. perfectly forconnecting Google.Uh at first let's actually make anotherAPI. It's very very important. It's veryimportant. Why? Because where we have tosave the API key right now. So let's sayconnections.This is the API endpoint. connectionsand let's add here save API key route.So API/connection slash save API key uhcreate here on root or route.tsandit's going to be kind of big. So let medo one thing. Let me create on helperfunction at first that mass keys. Whatis this? If the key there is no key thenreturn API key and we are basicallyshowing the last four digits of the APIkey. That's what we're doing. Then let'screate on post request here. So when weare actually saving on API key we're notgoing to show all the API keys, right?We're just showing the last four digitand this function is doing that. I hopeyou are understanding it now. Then",

Yeah. Then uh after account namewe we're going to check for the existingconnections with the same user. The samething we did in that authentication uhthat oath flow. Nowwe're going to import DB connections andand EQ from drizzle and the logic isactually same. This code is similar withour that route API route. So I'm notexplaining that's why.

You can see ifthe existing length is more than zerothen saved value is going to bedb.update. Just update the existingrecord and rotate the key. That's it.Okay. Otherwise,we have to insert the new record. So,we're going to insert the new recordhere.Yeah. And finally, we're going to returnthe values, but not the raw values.Definitely, we're not going to returnthe raw values. We're just returning theencrypted values, which no one can likeunderstand actually. just find anencrypted text.

Andinside this test workflow, we are goingto make an backbone for this saveworkflow because we're going to also dothe same thing in save workflow exceptfew things. Yeah, that's it for now.Let's come back here and let's start towork for test workflow feature. Now fortest workflow feature, we need some morethings. Let me do one thing. Let's goback to our note configurations modeland uh from here we",

We can comeback in our this dashboard templateslack and page.tsx.Inside hereyou can see handle test workflow. It'sactually empty and we have to call hereon function right now. Uh but beforecalling we have to create some hooks. Sowe're going to create some hooks rightnow. It's going to be actually ourhelper hooks. So let's come inside thishooks folder. Let's create a new folderby giving nameuseworkflowrun.ts.We can make this F2not capital. Yeah, workflow run.ts. Yes,what it's going to do it just going toactually track our workflow run. Yeah.So, um we need one more thing that islet's come back in this utils folder.Let's create a new folder by giving nameworkflows.And inside here we can createum topologyor not topology actually topologicallysortedts",
      "one more thing that islet's come back in this utils folder.Let's create a new folder by giving nameworkflows.And inside here we can createum topologyor not topology actually topologicallysortedts file. Yeah, at first add here on typefor our workflow node something likethis that ID string and that same dataobject with level step number isconfigured and config. After this we'regoing to add one type for workflow agesomething like this and then let's addhere our main function for our topologysorted. Yeah, topological sorted. Nowlet me explain you why do we need thisfunction. So this function basicallyreturns nodes in a topological orderusing an algorithm. Okay, it's justgoing to return the nodes in atopological order. It means it justensures the upstream nodes. Noprerequisites appear before dependence.Secondly, it gracefully falls back tooriginal order if the graph containscycles.Yeah. Or references unknown or any othermissing nodes. That's what thistopologically sorted function is",
      "dependence.Secondly, it gracefully falls back tooriginal order if the graph containscycles.Yeah. Or references unknown or any othermissing nodes. That's what thistopologically sorted function is doingfor us. So let's add here on in degreevariable here. It's basically on numberof incoming ages for each node ID. Okay.So we can create here on simple mapsince it's going to be number. Sostring and number after thisconstant adg it just adjacency. Okay,ADG meanings it's adjgency uh adjacencylist mapping source ID. It's just likethe array of target ids we can say. Sowe can say new mapstringand string.Yeah. Now we have to write here on forloop. So foruh let's write it manually. Yeah. So forconstant n of nodesin degree dot set that n dot id andzero. Yeah. And we have to call that adz or j actually not zjdo. set and we have to pass this n dotid and we have to pass this empty array.So we're just initializing the maps withall nodes ID here. That's what we'redoing in this loop. Uh after this",
      "not zjdo. set and we have to pass this n dotid and we have to pass this empty array.So we're just initializing the maps withall nodes ID here. That's what we'redoing in this loop. Uh after this let'sadd here another for loop and this oneis for building the adjacency andcompute in degrees. Yeah.So we can say constant E of agesthen if there is noadjacency ads uh sorry ADGhas this E dot sourcethenADGJ uh dot set E dots sourceand empty array. So what it's doing thisis basically ensuring the adjacency listentry exist for the source or not withthis with this logic. Now if it'savailable then what we have to do wehave to link the source. So let me justwrite here and comment that we have tolink the source here. Now link source uhlink source to targetate actually. Yeahlink source to targetate. Now adjdot gatee dot sourcethen dot pushand e dottarget. Yeah. Now we have to count theincoming age for the target. So we cancall this inderee dot set. We can passthis e dot target. We can pass",
      "Now adjdot gatee dot sourcethen dot pushand e dottarget. Yeah. Now we have to count theincoming age for the target. So we cancall this inderee dot set. We can passthis e dot target. We can pass thisinderee gate and e dot target or zerothen plus one. Cool. That's it. Now wehave to seed the Q with nodes that haveno prerequisites.So let's just write here on Qvariable which just going to be an uhempty array. uh array of string. So it'sjust going to be an empty array bydefault. Then let's write here an forloop. So for constant id uh id anddegree of in degreedot entries.Now inside here if the degree is zerothen q dot pushthis ID. Yeah. Now uh after this onewe are actually using here on algorithmcalled Khins algorithm. Uh pardon if I'mdoing any wrong pronunciations. Thespelling is like this. Let me show you.Likethis. So I I don't know really thepronunciations correctly. It might beCahins. I'm not sure. So it's actuallythis algorithm we are using here. Whatit's doing? Let me show you and let",
      "me show you.Likethis. So I I don't know really thepronunciations correctly. It might beCahins. I'm not sure. So it's actuallythis algorithm we are using here. Whatit's doing? Let me show you and let meexplain you. So it's basicallyrepeatedly remove a zero in degree node.This is what it's doing. So repeatedlyremove a zeroin degreenote. Yeah.Now we have to add it to the order anddecrement its neighbors in degrees. Solet's do that. constant orderwhich is going to be an array of stringand by default empty array. Now let'swrite here in while loop. So while qdotlengththen constant iduh q dot shiftthen next linewe have to push it inside the order. Soorder dotpush ID. What it's doing? It's justadding a current node to the finalsorted order. Yeah, but one minuteuh order push ID. What's wrong here?What it's saying?Just a minute. Q.length.Uhokay, let's do one thing. Let's add herethis then the error the warning will begone. It was just a typescript warning.Now forconstant next of adjacence.So,",
      "it's saying?Just a minute. Q.length.Uhokay, let's do one thing. Let's add herethis then the error the warning will begone.

Now in degreedot setnxt and d let's pass it. Now if our tequals to zerothen q dot push nxt. Yeah that's it. Wecan save it right now. Now uh after thislet's come out. Now if not all nodeswere processed we likely have a cycle orreferences right. So to missing nodes wehave to right now append the remainingnodes in their origin order as afallback. So we can say iforder dotlengthis not matching with our nodes.lengthlength.Then we have to add here the defaultfallback like constant remainingnotes dot filterid andno order includes when the order doesn'thave this IDthen ordersdotpush pushthis remaininguh let me see one thing so when theorder length is not matching with thisnodes dotlength then remaining",
      "andno order includes when the order doesn'thave this IDthen ordersdotpush pushthis remaininguh let me see one thing so when theorder length is not matching with thisnodes dotlength then remaining thisactually we don't need thisline uh we are doing here a smallmistake let's do one thing let's addhere on map at firstn andn dot id means node do id then we haveto run this filter. Yeah,perfect. Now finally we have to map thesorted ids back to actual node objects.So we can add here on by ID like thisthat new map nodes do map and this andthen finally we can return the order mapfrom here. So just return the order mapand we can save it. We can come back toour use workflow run again and we canstart to work here. So at first we needhere two type and we we can export itbecause we're going to need it in otherfiles that workflow node reference andworkflow age reference. Now we need ontype for run options like delay ms or onstep start on step complete or shouldstop. Yeah. Now we can create our",

Since we have somany nodes here. So suppose I'm addingthe Gmail here and discord here. So wehave to properly track it one note toanother node. And for Gmail we have todo one thing. For AI generate we have todo another thing. For discord we have todo another work. So that's why it'sactually complicated. We cannot do thesame thing for all the platforms. Thenit will not work. Why it will not work?because all of them are different intheir configurations. Yeah, that's it.So, let's add our workflow engine.At first, we are going to make here onsimple workflow node and workflow age. Iguess we do have this. I'm not sure.Workflow node and no no that's",

This is sincethis is on summarizer.

So ifbase [clears throat]includesuhemailsthenprompt will bepromptn meaning a space next line email themand lines. So we are basically adding aprompt in a different lines to givebetter context to AI. Yeah. Finally wecan return the prompt.That's it. So this is going to returnrender the prompt for us. Done. Nowfinallywe need actually some more uh helperfunction. and I'm going to quickly addit because it's going to be similar forall the other platforms. Okay, first ofall, call open AI.

Finally, we have to create anotherfunction for sendingmessage to discord. Okay, something likethis that send discord message.We have to send this webbook URL methodwill be post and this is the content.Yeah. Then we have to send an HTTPrequest. So I mean function not have tosend an HTTP request. This is onfunctions for sending HTTP request. Itjust going to send on post request orthis method. Which method is receiving?We're receiving from this parameter.Just send that request in this URL.We're receiving from this parameter.Yeah.Then finally we need on executioncontext typethis right now we're going to execute oncontext you can see we are going to havetrigger provider trigger data prompt",

Yeah. Then after type noteexecutor,let's make an executor functionsomething like this. Now inside executorif it's Gmail thenwe have to actuallyget back the connection ID from nodedata config connection ID. If it's notthere then missing Gmail connection ID.After that we have to look for unseenemail for connection. So it's veryimportant and it's going to be anotherfunction because we have to communicatewithGmails. Okay, that's what we have to do.And it's also going to be little bitbigger. not big like this file but yeahit's going to be a little bit biggerbecause in this function we're going todo",

Let's create ourworkflowfolder. And inside here we can say getunseenemailsforconnections. So for spelling is wrongor get unseen email is also fine. Getunseen emails.tsxor not. tsx since this is on server sidecode so we can make it tsyeah we don't need the xmlso first add here use servernowwe're going to add here on type foremail summaryso it's going to have ID which type willbe string and subjectwhich going to be string ornullfromwhich going to be string or nullsnippetwhich going to be string or nulland then let's add here an function getheaderlet's receive your headers erswe need this function for",

Uh then we need anotherfunction for listing our all unreadmessage ids. Yeah, message means Gmailsactually. So we need an endpoint onGmail endpoint and the URL endpoint isnot Gmail on URL endpoint. The URLendpoint is this that gmail GoogleAPIs.com/gmail/v1users messages this that unread andnewer than ond meanings one day. So weare actually looking for newer emails.If you want you can definitely make it3D means 3 days and level id is inbox.So we are just checking for inbox emailnot for any spam email.

If you want youcan include more here.Then constant raceawait page URLmethod will be getand headers will beauthorizationbeareraccess token. Yeah, that's it.Uh then finally if theresponse status is 401then it means there is something wrong.So we can say on tag error for upstreamhandling. Okay, you can add that commenteven here that tag error for upstreamhandling and it's unauthorized. Yeah, ifit's giving error, if the response isnot okay,we can say means it got failed, we cansay Gmail list error with that errormessage and that is status code. Yeah.Then finally, if it's everything isfine, we're getting back our unreademails, then we can just add on JSONthat I raise.jsonand we're returning that JSON dotmessages. Yeah. And we are just addinghere a map to send the array data. Okay,with an loop format. Uh after this weneed another function for getting themessage summary. It's important. Why dowe need",

It's very very important and it'smandatory. Why do we need this refreshGoogle access token? So Google actuallywork in a different approach. Suppose weare storing on token inside our databasebut after a certain time it will expireif we are not updating it and Googlewill not give us data then. So we haveto refresh the access token when theaccess token is expired then so that weget a new refresh token. That's why weare doing this. We are actually sendinganother requestto Google server. Now another functionwe need formaking our message our likeconversations as read. So mark messagesas read. We're sending request to thisGoogle Gmail endpoint again to modify itand we are just removing the level thatunread level. It means the messages orthe Gmails or emails will be read instatus in terms of status.Uh",
      "request to thisGoogle Gmail endpoint again to modify itand we are just removing the level thatunread level. It means the messages orthe Gmails or emails will be read instatus in terms of status.Uh yeah now our main functionthat actually it's going to an asyncfunction. So async functiongetunseen emails for connections. It'sgoing to receive one connection IDwhich will be stringandit's going to receive one promise I meanreturn and promise on email summaryarray.Yeah, inside here at first we have toload the connections.So load connections from where? From ourdatabase. So you can see uh DB. Soimport DB from our leaf O thenconnections from DB schemaEQ from Drizzel OM. So we are lookingfor our connections ID. Okay. For forwithout the like logged in connectionsorry without the connection ID and ifthe connection is not available thenconnection not found. After this we arelooking for access token. It's very veryimportant. So we're going to do heresome important work right now. First ofall, we're",
      "connection is not available thenconnection not found. After this we arelooking for access token. It's very veryimportant. So we're going to do heresome important work right now. First ofall, we're going to look for accesstoken encrypted one if it's available ornot in our data. If not, then missingGmail access token. After getting theaccess token, we have to change it tothat UTF8 string. Okay, string. And thenwe have to send this access token. Wehave to decrypt the access token. Wehave to pass this access token encryptedvalue. And we're getting here our accesstoken. Now, now uh let's do one thing.Let add here on late ids which is goingto be an array of stringby defaultnothing just an array. And let's addhere on try catchlike this. uh in the try partlet's call the ids and send this I meancall this list unread message ids andpass this access token in the catch partif it's catch any error then we have tohandle it very smartly why because ifthe status code is 401it meansthere is something",

It means access expired andno refresh token available. Yeah.Otherwise, we can do one more thing. Wecancheck for the refresh token encryptedand we can decrypt the refresh tokenright now. And then we can generate anew access tokenby using this refresh token. So thenfinally we can rotate our access token.So we can again rotate the access tokenand we can save it inside our databasesomething like this. So we are againcalling here encrypt function forencrypting the like new access token andthen finallywe are actually updating the databasethat connections table. Yeah.So that's it. Uh after this one else,this was if so if and elsewe can throw on error. Yeah,if there is nothis idlength is not available, it meansthe id is not any",
      "databasethat connections table. Yeah.So that's it. Uh after this one else,this was if so if and elsewe can throw on error. Yeah,if there is nothis idlength is not available, it meansthe id is not any array then return onempty array. Yeah. Now we have to fetchsummarizeconcurrently but cap in flight to avoidrate limit. So it's very importantbecause Google uh Gmail API has on ratelimiting for like any API request. Sothat's how we have to smartly do it. Weare adding here on promise.all all andwe're just running here on loop and wearegetting our sending a request to thisget message summary for with this accesstoken and id and then we're getting hereon summarize the main email summarizeyeah so we can send that from here andwe we can save it for now let's comeback hereimport it and that's it our this uhworkflow engine our emailwork is actually done a lot of work doneemail work done meanings uh because thatwas the most complex things now AIgenerateAI generate if the executors is AIgenerate",

So when theexecutors is discord, we have toreceive an o from node config orconnection metadata URL which is comingfrom here. If the web URL is notavailable then error we haven'tconfigured discord yet so that's why itmight look little bit different for younow but after connecting discord we willhave ano URL there yeah so yeah for nowfine uh finally the HTTP requestif the executor is HTTP request then dothisnow our last function or thatorchestration functionthis workflow engine.

Because we're going toadd here on todo not for now but lateron. So todo we can sayuh add locks. Why add locks? Meaningsafter this uh one this step we're goingto actually add the log executor deltafor this node since we don't have thelogging storing feature yet that's whywe're adding here on todo which we'll doin the like next part or the last partof this video series. Yeah. Now uh let'scome in this catch part in this catchblock. Now it's going to receive also anerror here. So let's say error type anynow uh if it's catch an error then it'sgoing to definitelylike we have to call this execute nodefrom here. So, execute nodeuhjust a minute.

Now ifthere is no rowthen what we have to do we have toinsert the user plan it meanings we areactually herechanging our users table or user usestable. So when there is no row for theuser ID meanings the user doesn't haveany data for the users table yet. So weare just creating on new data for theuser the plan free uses limit 1,00 usesone and user ID with that dynamic userID.Now elseif there is user ID what we have to do?We have to make desired limit. Sodesired limit is coming from our row dotrow. So if",
      "free uses limit 1,00 usesone and user ID with that dynamic userID.Now elseif there is user ID what we have to do?We have to make desired limit. Sodesired limit is coming from our row dotrow. So if the plan is pro then 10,000otherwise just 1,000. So here if row dotusees limitare not matching with our desired limitthenawait dbuh we have to updatethe users table right now if it's notmatching. Yeah. So when the uses limitand desired limit is not matching thenonly we have to update it but if it'smatching then there is something wrongright we cannot say that we can updateit then the user limit is exceed anduser have to update the plan yeah so rowdot users limit and desired limit our DBdot update and we're just updating theusers limit here with this desired limitupdated at this one so basically Whenwe're changing on plan, we're just doingit here. After this one, ifrow dot usesis zero or less equalsto row dotactually more equals not less equals rowdot use limitand deser limit thenreturnuh",

Yeah, in this uh catch we can justcancel log the error in this catch.Uh actually let's do some more workhere. Let's add here result.We have to call the executeworkflow function and we have to passthe notes the agesthenstop if empty trigger providersfor Gmail.So Gmail uh we make sure that we'redoing correct spelling. Gmail, Slack,Discord.Yeah.Uh then that's it. And we have to returnthe result in this catch part. If it'scatch any error, we can just console logthe error and console error the testflow error.Uh test workflow error and error dotmessage.Yeah, we can save it. Cool.

Oh my god, I forgot to add it.Yeah.So is running andactuallyI added here some weird thing. I don'tknow how did I write code like this.It should be number. Yeah. Now fine.Okay. So I'm working for so long andeverything is getting messy right nowbecause I'm my brain is just exhaustedright now. The code is",
      "did I write code like this.It should be number. Yeah. Now fine.Okay. So I'm working for so long andeverything is getting messy right nowbecause I'm my brain is just exhaustedright now. The code is not easy for mebecause I'm engineer. I'm notexperienced in this type of workflowcreating codes and writing notes. I'mjust not experienced in these things.But yeah, we are doing it and stillwe're doing it perfectly. So yeah, let'ssee. And I believe we will be able tofinish it. Nodes with running done. Whydo we need this? So we need this becausewe are updating the nodes with runningstate. Okay. So now instead of nodes wehave to change it nodes with running.Cool.Uh thenwe need on use effect h here. We can addthat in here. So use effectuse effect snippet.Andlet's add here on small functionsomething like this that let mountedfirst uh make it true. Then let's loadour user connections. Okay, we are justloading or fetching our usersconnections from our internal APIs.We're storing the value in this",

Yeah. Uh we don't needto update anything here. It looks good.Yeah. Good.And nowone extra thing is need and that is wehave to write nowmake on function fororganizing our data. Yeah I think weneed thisand one more thing mark step configured.Yeah we have this. So we just need tobuild our workflow data right now.Right. we have to like summarize or wehave to make a proper structure for ourdata. So let's create here on functionthat build workflow data. It's going tobe very important function we are makingon structure for our full data that sameuse call backand hereuh one minute I'm writing",
      "So let's create here on functionthat build workflow data. It's going tobe very important function we are makingon structure for our full data that sameuse call backand hereuh one minute I'm writing syntaxmistake. It should be like this. Yeah.And no comma. Why I'm writing herecomma?Uh here we have to return just templateID.Then name, descriptions, and nodes likethis. We're just like organizing thestructures. In nodes, we have ID, type,position, and data. B. Make sure thatyou are completely adding like this.So again template id which is going tobe slack name like this description likethis notes this is the array the mostimportant thing we need ID type the nodeposition the node data now after this weneed our ages data soagesand ages do map that our ids ids sourcetarget source handle and target handle.Finally, in this dependency array, let'sadd slackuh template and notesand ages.

So uh handle testworkflow inside herewe're going to at first call theworkflow data and we're going to callthis build workflow data. Now if all theconfigured I mean all the nodes are notconfiguredthen we're going to throw an error. Soall not configured it's actually comingfromcoming from another function. Let'screate a small function right now.It's going to be on use call backfunction and it's going to be verysmall. So let me quickly finish it.Something like this. So we are justchecking that all of our nodes areconfigured or not. Okay. So if they arenot configured then we are saying we'regiving an error that please configureall nodes before testing missing step.These are the steps. So even if",
      "our nodes areconfigured or not. Okay. So if they arenot configured then we are saying we'regiving an error that please configureall nodes before testing missing step.These are the steps. So even if we rightnow hit test let me give reloadtest.Uh wait something is wrong there. I'mactually feeling super angry because inthis function in this notes with runningfunction I did mistake for three or fourtimes I would say first of all in thisis running I was writing weird wordstops again here another mistake becausehere we need our data we haven't add ourdata see I am not doing mistake I didn'twrite this background it's done by ourlike VS code. So that's what I guesslast time even happened. I didn't writeit but it's automatically automaticallysuggested by VS code and it was themistake but right now if you if we comeback here you can see data are cominghere. So if you right now hit testplease configure all nodes beforetesting. Yeah so it's actually workingright now. The checking is",
      "but right now if you if we comeback here you can see data are cominghere. So if you right now hit testplease configure all nodes beforetesting. Yeah so it's actually workingright now. The checking is workingproperly. Uh after this if our nodechecking donethenwe can add here on try catch statement.So in the try partset node errors.It's going to be an empty object atfirst.Then constant server run. Let's call ourtest workflow function.Pass the workflow dataand usercall the run sequenceand pass the workflow data dot nodesand workflow data dot agesand delay ms 800 millisecond.Now finally resultawait server run. If the resultandresult dot okayand stepsuh actually it should be an string stepsinresultuh and array dot is array result dotstepsThen we have to show here an error map.Yeah.So error mapsomething like this just on for loop forour result and steps.

Uh our work is actuallydone except one small thing in the UI.We haven't finished it yet because wedidn't have the data here.Soinside here we can say when the isrunning is true is running state is truethe nodes are running then we can addhere on badgesomething like this that runningstep and running step number and thatnumber. Yeah that's it. Now we can doone thing. Let's say let's add your HTTPrequestand connect it with this open model.Select our Gmail for AI generate.Let's say summarizethe email.Open AI model. To be honest, I addedhere on like dummy API key. Even in ourdatabase, it's also dummy API key.We have to add on real open AI API keyright now. So let me delete it and letme actually check back from open AIplatform. So platform.opai.com.Let me do login and let me copy my APIkeys from open AAI.We need",

So for you I'm creating an APIkeys but don't try to use it because I'mgoing to delete it. You have to likesign up in open AI platform and you haveto like uh you have to deposit $5 atleast. Without deposit depositing $5,you will not get access to this API willnot work for you. And then you have tocopy your API key. Hit done. Come backhereand paste it. Then hit saveconfiguration.Cool. You can see we have right now ouropen API keys perfectly configured. NowHTTP requestuh again I did mistake for HTTP requestsomewhere.Let me see guys I always do mistakes.Mistakes mistakes is our life. Sothe mistake should be in this",
      "API keys perfectly configured. NowHTTP requestuh again I did mistake for HTTP requestsomewhere.Let me see guys I always do mistakes.Mistakes mistakes is our life. Sothe mistake should be in this nodeconfigurations model. Let's check ourHTTP request. HTTP request.It looks good. Check the case. Um, kindof sure that I did that same spellingmistake, but let me check again.HTTP request. Was it HTTP request orsomething different?Actually different. Instead of a colon,it should be on hyphen.Yeah, now you can see it's coming here.Now here we can add HTTP localhost30,000 so that it give on 200 response.Yeah. So for now let's hit test.Uh something is definitely wrongsomewhere.Let me check why it's still saying thisum our this let me do one thing. Let'scome back here. All not configured.Here is the mistake. I found themistake. We updated set nodes. Verygood. But who will update the setconfigured steps? That's why I'mthinking what's happening. Yeah.Solet's add brief and scape number. It'sgoing to",

It'sgoing to be true. Done. Save it. Comeback here again.And sadly we have to again hit this saveconfigurations.Summarizethe email. Why we have to do it again?Because the website just got refreshed.That's whyuh from here we can add it this one thesaved one save configuration. No, wedon't need discord because we haven'tconnect it yet.So let's add HTTP request hereand HTTPclone/ localhost3000. Cool. Now if we hit test here yougo running statebut where's the borderworkflow is working very good to seethis but where is the border and uh inUJ you can see right now UJ is onesomething is wrong we're going to checkit nowuh it's not working it's not workingbecauseuh I I think I found the problem guys.Let's try to understand why it's notworking. Because the running step numberis undefined. That's why in here when wewere",
      "it's not working it's not workingbecauseuh I I think I found the problem guys.Let's try to understand why it's notworking. Because the running step numberis undefined. That's why in here when wewere watching the message, we didn't seethat number that step number which stepis right now running. It means thatrunning step number is not working. Solet's go to our use workflow run again.And I was trying to checking this setrunning step number and I noticed we'rejust making it null. So where we aresetting the value? We are not settingvalue from anywhere. See it was themistake. So where we have to set set thevalue. See here the step we're gettingthe step number. Which step we'rerunning. So simply we have to add heresetuh running node sorry note n note stepnumber and we have to pass this stepinside this. That's it. Nothing else.Now what will happen? Nothing. We haveto again configure it since it's givingon refresh to our website that's why theall datas are actually going where indevelopment",

We haveto again configure it since it's givingon refresh to our website that's why theall datas are actually going where indevelopment mode that we have toactually we have to we have no otheroptions than this. Yeah. So we here wecan say summarizethe emailfrom template and open a API key. Savethis http requestlocalhost3000.Yeah, I don't know why it'sautomatically like filled in. I am nottelling it to fill the value. It justhappening because of my browser. Yeah,but if I right now hit test, you can seeit's working.It's actually working.So interesting to see even if you openour terminal we will be able to see allthe notes step and that's what I wassaying that we need to store this all ofthis workflow executions all nodesexecution we have to store it somewherewhere we have to store you might bethinking let's store it inside ourdatabase no that's not the exact likeperfect way because these datas it'skind of like locks And you",

Let me showyou click house and open source uhdatabase for storing logs, analyticsthings like highcale data we can say. Weuse click house for that. But for thisuh like first part I'm not using it. Forthe second part I'll use another smallSAS. By using that SAS we can integratelogging within just 1 minute. And I'llshow you that in that second part of thevideo series or the last part actuallysecond part meanings last part. So yeahyou can see our testing uh workflowautomations is working.

At the end it'ssummarizing the email that's so we canunderstand it. You can see thesummarization is actually working.That's why our execution was successful.So we can come back uh in this u thistime you can see the uses is two becausewe executed two times that's why. Nowwhat next? Since the testing feature isworking, we can integrate the billingfeatures. Okay, very important onsubscription. Since this is going to belike limited for 1,000. So suppose I'madding here limit usage is 1,000. Okay,let's say change it. Come back here. Hitthis test.You can see uses limit exceed. Pleaseupdate your plan. Workflow is not goingto work right now. the workflow will notrun. We must have to update our plannow. So that's why we have to start towork for this billingpage and we're going to work here rightnow. So yeah, that's it. Let's call",
      "now. the workflow will notrun. We must have to update our plannow. So that's why we have to start towork for this billingpage and we're going to work here rightnow. So yeah, that's it. Let's call upseverything.Let's go to app dashboard and create anew folder by giving name billing.Inside here we can create on page.tsx.KSXRFCand billing page. Now for billing as Isaid earlier we're going to use herefirst of all our that traditional Stripefor accepting card payments but rightnow it's 2025 and it's the world of Iwould say it's the world of Bitcoin andit's the world of digital currency. Sothat's why we should integrate somedigital currency payment gateway as welland that's why we're going to use ourtoday's video sponsor Cryptomas foraccepting cryptocurrency payment. Allright. So right now you can see meinside Cryptomas website. This is theirpayment gateway page. You will find outthis website link in my videodescription box. You can just clickthere or even you can search forCryptomas on",
      "can see meinside Cryptomas website. This is theirpayment gateway page. You will find outthis website link in my videodescription box. You can just clickthere or even you can search forCryptomas on Google or like in any ofyour browser. And after clicking thelink, you will be redirected to thiswebsite. And from here, you can justclick this get started button. And fromhere, you have to add your email addressand password. And then you have toselect your country. And then you haveto agree with their terms andconditions. And I certified that I'm nota citizen of or residents of the UnitedStates. Why? I don't know. The Cryptomasplatform does not serve citizens orresidents of the United States ofAmerica. All right. So it's currently atthis moment it's blocked for US. Ireally don't know why it's why that butyeah since I'm not from US so I don'thave to worry for that but you just haveto create an account here and it'sreally very simple to create an accountin here. Since I do have an account",
      "why that butyeah since I'm not from US so I don'thave to worry for that but you just haveto create an account here and it'sreally very simple to create an accountin here.

Aftercreating or after doing login into youraccount, you just have to click thissettings and at first you have to finishthis KYC verification. It's veryimportant. You just have to submit yourlike passport or your national ID cardor your driving license or like anygovernment document to approve uh toactivate your account. It's requiredinside any like payment gatewayapplications even on Stripe. You mustneed to verify your account. So afterthat your KYC verification will besuccessfully done. After verifying KYCit's very easy. It will be done withinjust like 10 or 20 minutes. Sometimes ittakes long time like 1 day or",

Sometimes ittakes long time like 1 day or 2 days butit should not be more longer than that.After activating your account from herewe have to click this all it icon. Andfrom this business since we're going toreceive payment so we have to create onmerchant accounts. So from here we canhit this create merchant button and inthis merchant name you have to writeyour business name. For me I'm writing Bcode private limited. You can just writeyour business name. Uh the name mustonly contain letters number dash andunderscores. Okay. So we can say B codeprivate limited.Yeah, like this. Now here you go. We areready to set up our account. Now you cansee private limited merchants accountcreation done. Now we can create herepayment by link or there have somewidgets. You can just click here. Thenyou can see they have so many widgetslike you can",
      "cansee private limited merchants accountcreation done. Now we can create herepayment by link or there have somewidgets. You can just click here. Thenyou can see they have so many widgetslike you can create here on widgets nameand you can give here form or button orQR code. It's just like the payment formyou want for your userand the currency the amount to pay andpayment name and success pay URL. Butfor us we don't need that. So we cancome back here again and we can hit thispayment by link. So let's click here andwe have to select a type from here. Uhby the way to create payment link pleasepass project moderation. So very veryimportant here we have to add on projectlink. So uh let's do one thing. Let'shit leave a request.So we have to add here our website orour telegram bot. If you have anytelegram bot you can just add that. Forme I'm just adding here our website linkthat bcodemi.comproject name you can add here yourproject name like for us it could bealso flowex but since I'm creating",
      "bot you can just add that. Forme I'm just adding here our website linkthat bcodemi.comproject name you can add here yourproject name like for us it could bealso flowex but since I'm creating itfor boddemi that's why I'm writing hereboddemiyeah now very important thing and thatis we have to confirm the domain ourbusiness domain that we actually own thedomain that boddemi.com I have access inthere so that's why I have to add thisDNS record or even I can use this metatag on the site or we can also use anHTML file in there. But the likerecommended approach is this one. We canjust copy this. This is actually easy.So let me actually go back to myNameChip account since uh I have ourBody domain access in hereand right now I'm inside my Bodmi emailaccount. So here I'm just clicking addnew add new record and the record typewill beuh you can see that it's saying on textrecord actually so let's copy this andadd here on text record value is thisone and host host they're saying herenothing so we",
      "record and the record typewill beuh you can see that it's saying on textrecord actually so let's copy this andadd here on text record value is thisone and host host they're saying herenothing so we can add here just add itand we can hit saveperfect now we can hit check buttonAnd it's going to actually take sometime for confirming the domain. Allright, you can see right now it's sayingconfirmed. So our domain confirmation isactually done. So we can hit thisconfirm domain right now. Now projectmoderations will take like 24 hours orsome time to approve our account. Andafter our after getting our businessapproved, we will have access to the APIkeys. We can just use the API keys forimplementing payment G inside ourproject. Yeah, but for now we just haveto wait for a certain time untilCryptomas accept our business accountcreation request. So I'll come back whenthey will accept our business accountcreation request.All right, you can see right now ourbusiness account is activated. ourmerchant",
      "accept our business accountcreation request. So I'll come back whenthey will accept our business accountcreation request.All right, you can see right now ourbusiness account is activated. ourmerchant settings. From merchantsettings, you can see our business isright now active and we do have thepayment API key. It is not quite fast.It took around 6 hours to active theaccount but finally we have our accountactive. So right now we can implementcryptomas with our applications by usingthis API key, by using this merchant keyand many more things. Yeah. So right nowlet's go back to our project again. Andat this moment we have to focus on thedesigning part because we just have anempty billing page. We have to make hereon beautiful design to just match withthe vibe of our application. So let'sfirst finish the design part for thisbilling page. Then we'll implementcryptomas and stripe at the same timebecause most of them actually not mostof them all of stripe and cryptomas theprocedure will be",
      "finish the design part for thisbilling page. Then we'll implementcryptomas and stripe at the same timebecause most of them actually not mostof them all of stripe and cryptomas theprocedure will be kind of similarbecause we're actually planning toimplement on recurring uh paymentmechanism. So that's why it's going tobe kind of same. I mean since we'regoing to uh use on payment link same foruh cryptomas on payment link and samefor stripe. So for payment link we don'thave to write a lot of code. It'sactually easier to set a payment linkand it's also more convenient for anylike subscription base or requiringbases. Yeah. So at first at this momentlet's finish our designing part. Let'sadd here use client. Why do we need useclient? Because we're going to add heresome state. That's why we must have tomake it use client. Otherwise we cannotuse use context or context insideserverside components right yeah becausewe don't have the access of that DOM oryeah we don't have access of DOM dommeans",

So, use effect.Why do we need an use effect here? thiswe have to fetch for our logged in useruses information. So we can say constantloadusesit's going to be an as sync functionsince we're going to call on server sidefunction.So if there is user and user dot id thenonly do this that constantracecall ourfage uses function. You might bethinking from where it's coming. Yeah itdoesn't exist yet but we have to createit. We're going to do it. It's going tobe very small function.Then set uses we're going to pass hererace. Actually race is good enoughbecause we're going to send the fulldata from this fetch uses function.Finallylet's call the load",
      "tobe very small function.Then set uses we're going to pass hererace. Actually race is good enoughbecause we're going to send the fulldata from this fetch uses function.Finallylet's call the load uses and independency array we have to must adduser is when there is no user then it'sgoing to return null. Definitely this ifstatements going to be undefined butwhen there is user informations thenit's going to work. So that's why wehave to add that user in this dependencyarea. I think you know about like thiscommon use effect uses.Yeah. Now fetch uses. So we have to goback to our actions folder. Inside herewe can create a new folder by givingname uses.And inside here we can say page uses.ts.Yeah. Inside here at first we have toadd use server to make it on server sidecomponent. Yeah. Thenconstant fetchujs and I just want to write it bymyself. I love to write this type ofserver side small small functionsbecause it looks cute. You can see itlooks really very cute. So it canreceive a user ID",
      "fetchujs and I just want to write it bymyself. I love to write this type ofserver side small small functionsbecause it looks cute. You can see itlooks really very cute. So it canreceive a user ID which type will bestringand thenwhat do we need? We just have to fetchour data. So DB from our lipselect and select from where? Selectfrom uses. So usesand actually where from uses fine butwhat we have to do where so uses andwherethe EQ is uses dotmeanings uses dot user id is equals touser id then yeah and limit should beone done. Now finally return rowsor null. Yeah, we can save it. We cancome back here. Uh by the way, we haveto export it. I forgot to export thefunction. So export default fetch usesand we can save it. We can come backhere. We can import it like this. And wecan save it. Hthenwe are reaching nothing here because wedidn't do anything. If we right nowconsole lock thisuses data you will see the magic that wedo have our uses informations here thatplan is free. This is the ID. This",

Now we can deletethe console lock since it's workingright now. We can go back to our mainwork to the designing. Now uh we need onhelper variables we can say that useruns. So uses data dot usagesor zero.Thentotal runs which is going to bevery simple uses data dot users limitor 1,000.But there is an important thing. Yeah, Ijust realized becausewe have to write here another logic. Thecurrent plan equals to prothen 10,000or 1,000.Yeah. Done.Now we need one very important staticarray for our plants. Something likethis. That plants name will be free.Price is $0. descriptions perfect uhperfect for trying",

You can add hereanything whatever you want just like formarketing. But definitely add here realthings since this is for a tutorial. Sothat's why I just added here like onstatic data.Uh now another very important thing fornow let's make it static. Okay butdefinitely we're going to make itdynamic after some time that billingstory let's add here on ID on date onamount on method on status and you cancopy the same thing just change the IDchange this method and like date oranything and then you can like this forstripe stripe and this is for cryptomasmeanings it paid by usingcryptocurrency.

Yeah,this is on functionfor now. Just console lock something.Let's try payment because we're going toadd it later one.Yeah. Uh now we need the same functionagain but this time upgradecrypto.So cryptowe can say crypto payment. Yeah. Uh nowfinally another very important functionit's for handle select plan. Sowhen the plan name equals to currentplan when it's matching then return itbut if the plan name is free thendowngrading to free plan if it's likedifferent then actually at this momentwe don't need any toast message becauseit's not any realthing I mean when you are clicking freeit's definitely not changing it we haveto make API routes or server actions forthat yeahcurrently let's come back inside hereright now and add on class name that P6space Y6inside here let's add another div withon H1that billing and usesyeah",

We can save it. Here you go.Billing and uses.After this, let's add on paragraph thatmanage your subscriptions and V stat uhstatistics. Yeah.Then right nowwhat next? Here we have to add on rule.Here will be our uses and accountinformations. And this two will be ourpayment card. Yeah. So let's do it rightnow. Let's come outside from this divand let's create another div with kindof big class name since it's for grid.So something like this. Maximum width 6LMX auto grid and grid calls one from LG3gap 6 and items traced. Uh yeahinside here we have to add on anotherdiv for our current plan. Yeah and let'sadd here cur fromour curt component. Socardand this is the class name. We can seethe class name we have on minimum heightof 500 pixelinside",

Inside here we can add anotherdiv with class name like this thatcurrent title current plan you'recurrently on this current plan. So youcan see current plan you're currently onthe free plan because that's what thecurrent plan of this user. After this weneed on batch. So after this div we canadd here on batch. Let's import batchfrom our components. And this is thelike badge name I mean the plan name notbadge name current plan. Uh after thisour header work is actually done. So wecan go outside from the header and wecan add here our curtcontent. Yeah. So let's import curtcontent from component cyc.Here we're going to add up another DIVwiththese buttons thatupgrade with Stripe orpay with crypto",
      "the header and wecan add here our curtcontent. Yeah. So let's import curtcontent from component cyc.Here we're going to add up another DIVwiththese buttons thatupgrade with Stripe orpay with crypto something like this. Youcan see I'm just slowly moving it. Soyou can just read the class names itjust on button with just on text andnothing else. It's just basic webdesign. So upgrade with stripe or paywith crypto. That's it. Uh after thisafter this button and div, we have tostart another div. It's actually for ourmonthly uses. Yeah. So monthly uses.Let's add on small div like this withclass name this. You can see the classname. Then we need to add on another divinside here. Something like this. whichspan monthly uses. If the used run ismore than total runs, then text rate 400otherwise text green and used runs oftotal runs runs. That's why we createdthis variables. We can save it.

Ifit's not coming for you, just typereload window and you can click there.It will give on reload in your codeeditor without restarting the server.Yeah. So, you can see monthly uses 1,00on of 1,000 uh runs. That's why it'sshowing red. And this is the reason Ichange it to 1,001 so that I can showyou the red icons. Yeah. Actually,it should be something like this. Evenif the total runs is uh 1,000 and usedrun is 1,000, it will still give rederror. Yeah.Uh then after this div let's let's addhere another div with class name H2BGgray700roundedfulluh andoverflowhidden. Yeah.Inside here we need another div.

Yeah,something like this. Actually, one runsover this month. Yeah, extra one runs.It's sayingnowafter this div card content card andthis div,let's add here another div for ourmonthly subscription plan.So something like this on class namethat grid class name again and right nowwe need on another component called plancard.

So at first import cardcontent cart header card title fromcomponents UI card then button and badgeand check from lucid react and rest fromcomponents folder we need on interfacehere for plan card props like name pricedescription features is popular iscurrent or one select.

Let's do one thing.Let's come back here.import plan card and we have to passhere all of thoselike parameters. Yeah. So we have topass keys or key name, price,description, features is popular, iscurrent and one select.

Thenhere you go.You can see the features are appearinghere. It's looking beautiful. Nowuh after this we need on button forchecking or changing the plan.So something like this that is currenttrue then current plan otherwise chooseplan otherwise you can say this classnames for is current this one for ispopular this one otherwise by defaultthis one.

So it's looking actually beautifulright now.Uh now what next? Still we have to addthat our billing history for anyapplications like for requiringrequiring paymentrecurring payment we should add billinghistory otherwise how we will know thatfor how many months you have paid to thesubscriptions.

So right now what next?Right now the on and only thing is wehave to implement this upgrade withstripe and pay with crypto dynamically.So we will do that right now. So let'sstart it right now. All right. So rightnow we have to create an API endpointfor the payment link for the paymentredirect link. So in this API folder wecan create a new folder by giving namebilling. Inside this billing folder wecan create a new folder by giving namekryptomus.So kryptomusand inside here we can say link a newfolder. And then we can create onroute.ts.So what it's actually doing you can seebilling/cryptomas/linkand route.ts.So it's just on API endpoint.API/billing/crypto/ink.It's our API endpoint. Yeah.

Create a new folder forStripeuh not folder. Let's do one thing.Stripe.ts.So it should be on file not folder. Sodelete the folderlips and lib. Wait. So there are twolips. Uh we don't need lips folder. Thenthen lib is also fine. Just create astripe. Another onekryptonous.TS. Yeah. And in this crypto.ts Yes,we're going to set up cryptomas rightnow. So, we need to install a newlibrary calledCryptomusandJS. We make sure that you're writingthis same spelling crypto and JS. It's aTypeScript npm library for implementingcryptomas inside our NodeJS project.Yeah, we can import uh something fromcryptomasjs. And here we have to importkryptonousclient. Yeah. Now export",

Now export constant uhcryptomous clientequals to new crypto client. We have toadd here our merchant ID which is goingto be process envantIDor on empty string. Uh we also need toadd payment key and payout key. So it'sgoing to be something like this justcryptomas merchantuu ID cryptomus API key and crypto APIkey for payout key as well. So we cansave it right now. Now we need thiscrypto merchant UID and API key. Let'sadd it inside here. So at firstcryptomer uh crypto merchant uu ID andAPI key from where we will get this? Wehave to go back to our cryptomasdashboard again. Let me show you thisone. So crypto let me at first to log inin another tab. Yes, I did loged out. Solet me just do log in then that merchantaccountand actually I'm doing in a differentscreen that's why you're not watchingit. Just a",

Andthis is the merchant ID. Don't copypaste my merchant ID and my payment APIkey. It's not going to work because Ican regenerate it any time. And it'sactually like based on our domain. Imean in crypto there is a specific rulesthat it's configured with boddemi.com.So right now if I want to use it forflowex.com it's not going to workbecause it configured only forboddem.com. So even if you're copyingit, it's not going to work for yourproject on production. Yeah. Uh now uhhere merchant U ID. Let me paste themerchant U ID from here. I'm justcopying it from here.

Afterthis our cryptomasthis setup is done we can come backinside our that APIuh billing and this crypto link route.Yeah inside here at firstlet's create here on API route. Soexport a sync functionpost it's going to be on uh post requestendpoint it's going to receive a requestand inside here we are receiving thedata from request dot JSON.Yeah. Now uh actuallyI did a small mistake not body becausewe have to receive here amountcurrencyand most important user ID. Yeah. Solet's make here on payload object rightnow that amountthencurrencyuser iduh and here it's giving an error becausewe have to add here a yeah amount notamount amount yeah so after user id wehave to add",

Okay. So we cansay process dot envnextpublic base URL.So base URL meanings ourlike website base URL. Yeah. So let medo one thingjust a minute.Uh next public app URL we do alreadyhave in our env.

And finallywe can return a new responsethat JSON dot stringifyrace and status will be 200.That's it. Our endpoint is ready forcryptomus.Yeah, it's actually perfectly ready. Nowwhat next?We can come back here and we canactually do one more thing but we willdo that later that way endpoint this webhooks and cryptomas. Uh let's come backin just billing again from this upgradecrypto we can right now call it. So uhat first we need here on a new stateright nowthatuse statethat paymentloader and set payment loaderby default make it false. Copy this setpayment loader. Come back here at firstmake it true. Yeah. Nowconstant raceawait we can use here fetchthen slash API we have to make it",

Now otherwisewe can pass an error that and you canshow an error that cryptomous paymentlink is unavailableat this moment. Yeah that's it. Uh wecan do one thing. We can cut all of thisinside on try catch statement. So trycatch this try part let's add it and inthis catch part we can say toast doterrorfail to startcrypto payment meanings API error thisone and finallywe have to make this to false but thenwe have to add it before try yeah or wecould add it also here. Fine. Actuallyfine. So finallyit should befalse. Uh let's do one thing. Let's addit here. It makes more sense.Yeah, we can save it.Nowif we come back here, if we hit this paywith crypto,just give reload. Since we started ourserver, we have to give on reload paywith crypto.And here we go.

You can scan your cryptomas uhlike no not cryptomas I mean any uhcryptocurrency wallet and you can justpay to this account by using the likescanner but at this moment cryptomasdoesn't have any sandbox mode fortesting it in locally it means youcannot test this payment gateway inlocally right now they're working withsandbox mode but they have not done yetso that's why what we have to do thenyou can check it with just a smallamount like 10 cent or 5 cent.

Let me show you in boddemi. Uhwe are also using cryptomas.Actually my Wi-Fi network is prettyslow. I have no idea what's happeningwith my Wi-Fi network from the last fewdays. Let me change my network. Uh Iactually cannot change it.This is very sad to see.Let me do one thing. Let me check it inSafari.So be code me.Yeah. See here it's working. uh from thesource codeswe can go herethen access source code you can see payby crypto so if I click here I can againpay this with cryptocurrency and it'sactually working if you pay it I willreceive the money in my account and youwill get access to the source codebecause it's",

Now nextone is our this handle upgrade stripe.Another most important function and it'sgoing to be very easy. So let's comeback here in this billing. Let's createa new folder by giving name stripe andstripe then linkandroute. Yes, similar like cryptosbut we have to definitely write heredifferent code since it's uh stripe butactually not link it should be check outstripe doesn't have link like crypto ithas checkout so check out and herewe have to install uh a new librarydefinitely for stripeso 1 it.Let's come back",

Now inthis check outsince we do have stripe ready we can doour main work. Now here at firstexport as sync functionpostconstantsessionuh actuallywe are checking here theAPI is authenticated or not.

Checkout is actuallyready.We can come back in this billing againand for stripewe're going to actually do kind ofsimilar thing. Let's come back here. Soat first add on try catch statementset payment loader make it true.We're going to send here on postrequest.

You can see we're completelyworking here without anylike session ID, order ID or anythinglike that. You might be thinking fromwhere then we will get the order. Wedon't need order ID.

Yeah. Same forpay with crypto. Yeah.Cool. So if even we right now click uhsorry not here. If we right now clickthis upgraded stripe it will give error.Why? Because we have to add our envvariables properly.Sostripe prize ID and stripe secret key.So I'm adding it in a different screenbecause it's again on private thing andI don't want to show this to you. So Iam adding actually my stripe testingkeysand it's going to bedifferent for you. You just have to doit by yourself. But just a minute. Thisis the env fileand let me uncomment it.

You can see it'sredirecting but dashboard undefinedmeaning something is wrong there. Let megive on reload.Actually guys, it's not working for twobig mistake. First of all, this JSON.h,it should be JSON dot URL, not Here.Yeah, first like like the main fix isdone. Secondly, we need to create a newproduct. I was actually using adifferent product. It's going to workright now, but the product is not same.So, let's go to this product catalog.Let's create here a new product forFlow XPro descriptions. You can just writeFlowEx Pro for now. And it it's going tobe on recurring product with $19.99pricing. Yeah. And it's going to bemonthly billing period. We can hit thisadd product. After hitting this addproduct, you will see that we do haveour product price link. How? Just clickhere and click this copy price ID.That's it. We're",

Let metake it back here again.And right now,let's come back here.Uh, sorry, actually here. Then hit thisupgrade with stripe.And this time, you can see it's takingus to checkout.stripe.comand subscribe to fluxpro. This is our$19. Now, what we have to do? What next?Next is we have to create on web hookendpoint. It's very very important rightnow. So for web hook endpoint let's goto this API folder. In this API folderlet's create a new folder by giving nameweb hook. And inside here in this webhooks folder let's create two newfolder. One for stripe another one forkryptomus. Yeah. So stripe andkryptomus. Inside stripe, let's add ourroute.ts.And",
      "nameweb hook. And inside here in this webhooks folder let's create two newfolder. One for stripe another one forkryptomus. Yeah. So stripe andkryptomus. Inside stripe, let's add ourroute.ts.And inside here, in this route.ts, we'regoing to right now write a lot of code.So, first of all,uh let me do one thing. Let me actuallycopy some quotes from here because it'sgoing to be similar for you, foreveryone actually. Uh becausehere we're using this from Strapdocumentation. Yeah. Now let's createhere our that main as sync functionthat post and requestthen constant body equals to awaitrequest dottext. So we're getting our data here,our body data. Now we need our stripesignature.It's very important. So stripe signaturewe're taking it back from our header.Stripe signature. After this we need ontry catch statement. So let's add hereon try catch statement. Inside the stripwe have to pass value. We have to set onvalue for on late variable called event.So let event it's going to be stripeevent.",
      "catch statement. So let's add hereon try catch statement. Inside the stripwe have to pass value. We have to set onvalue for on late variable called event.So let event it's going to be stripeevent. Yeah. So event and stripe wavehooks dot construct event. We have topass this body signature and our stripewave hook secret. Yeah, a newvariable and we have to create it. I'llshow you how. It's actually easy andit's going to be again completelydifferent for you. But you don't have tocreate it from the dashboard. Stripesystem is right now different. You haveto create it from your terminal. I'llshow you how. uh for now let's add hereonconsole log thatweb hook signatureverifiedfailed. Yeah, we can say this. We canpass here error dotmessage. Yeah.and error is giving type warning. Solet's add on type for error like any ifit's not matching with the signaturelet's return onerror dot message. Let's return a newresponse that web hook error status code400. Yeah after this we have to handlethe events.",

So if the event typeif the event type is customerdot subscriptiondot deletedthenwe have touh actually we have to do what? We haveto take back our customer informations.How? We have to go to the subscription.Uh actually subscription.Yeah, let's do one thing. Constantsubscription we are receiving it fromevent dotdata dot object from stripe. Yeah. Andcustomer is coming from thissubscription customer. We're retrievingthe customer full data. Then we'rechecking for the customer email so thatwe can actually look for the user. Yeah.Uh now one thing we must need right nowlet's go to our neon database. So neondatabaseit's actuallyum hereand in this uses you can see we do haveuser ID we don't have user email so wecan do one",
      "Yeah.Uh now one thing we must need right nowlet's go to our neon database. So neondatabaseit's actuallyum hereand in this uses you can see we do haveuser ID we don't have user email so wecan do one thingwe actually need here our user ID andcustomer will not have our user IDSo it's for subscription deleted.All right. At first let's find out ouruser informations with this customeremail. So awaituh DBdot user it should be DB dot selectand uh from our user table. So user andthen we cannot give it name to user. Souser data uh and user dot from whereright. So we need to match it from let'simport EQ from Grizzel RM then user doemail and customer. So customer doat string.Yeah that's it. We're getting our userdata here but we have to give here onlimit that one so that we will get hereon array.Now we can update our uses databasebecause that's what we have to update.We have to update our users table.

What next? The next one isourinvoicepayment failed. Yeah. So, invoicepayment failed.It's also going to receive invoice andcustomerhere like this. And we're getting ourcustomer. Now, we have tocheck the email from the customer. Whatwe were doing the same thing. Now, wehave to do what? We have to do the samething what we did here. We have toupdate the user data and we have toupdate the users table as well. Yeah.Now this was this all were negativeright? If there is invoice",

So then constant invoice eventdot data dot object as stripe dotinvoice. Yeah. Now constant customer ID.customer ID the type of invoice dotcustomerif it's stringthen invoice dot customerotherwise null.So we are getting our customer ID fromhere.

      "ID fromhere. Yeah.Then after this what we need? We needour email. Sowe are actually doing the same thingagain herethat email we need our user email ourcustomer email then what we're going todo we're going to check for the useraccount. So we can do that like this. Souser data is here. Now customer is nothere. So it should be just email fromhere.

Invoice ID is this one, thisemail or blah blah blah. You can justsee. So actually though we don't haveany invoice. We just have email andcustomer. Yeah, that's it. Nowuh what we have to do? We have to justmodify the user plan.How can we do that? We can just copythis one again. We can paste that inhere. Instead of uh free, let's make itrow. Nowthat's it. Done.

So, eventdot of type done.andthen return new responsethatreceived and status 200.Yeah. Inside this catch block,let's add an console lock thaterror and the error message. And we canreturn an error to our web hookresponse. Yeah, I know it was crazy bigand stripe web is actually not easy toset up. You have to write so much code,so many lines of code and it's likenatural when you're working with stripe.Uh but Cryptomas is completely differenton this thing. I know they don't havefeatures like Stripe yet because they'rea new company",
      "lines of code and it's likenatural when you're working with stripe.Uh but Cryptomas is completely differenton this thing. I know they don't havefeatures like Stripe yet because they'rea new company compared to St. Stripe,but they're really trying to do it. I'llshow you how can you stripe uh sorry howcan you implement way for cryptomas alsothat's going to be easy not like thisstripe one but now the most importantthing is you have to do login to yourstripe account like this stripe login Iam already logged in so that's why I'mnot typing that now after that we haveto write this stripe list and forward tothis API web hooks and stripe let'spress enteryou will get here your web hook signingsecret key. Okay, it's going to bedifferent for everyone. It's going to bedifferent for you, going to be differentfor me. Okay, so let me add it in theenvy right now. Otherwise, it will notwork. So at first, let me paste thevalue and the web hook secretuh variable name is stripe web hooksecret. So let's",
      "differentfor me. Okay, so let me add it in theenvy right now. Otherwise, it will notwork. So at first, let me paste thevalue and the web hook secretuh variable name is stripe web hooksecret. So let's add stripe web hooksecret.And yeah, done. So that's it. We cansave it now.You can see it's ready here. Now we cancome backto ourwebsite.We can hit this upgrade with stripe fornow. first one. Thenlet's use our testing card here that4242 4242.Andlet me just write on simple name and hitsubscribe.Okay, done.Here we go. So success true. It meansit's actually working. Let's see the webhook response. It's also giving 200. Itmean it's working. Uh, perfect. We cancome back to here. Let's go to neon.Let's give reload. Here we go. Our planis right now pro. Uh, one thing we didon small mistake when the plan is pro,we have to update this uses limit to10,000. Okay. So, we can easily do that.That's going to be very easy. That's notany hurt thing. We just have to make it10,000 where when we're updating",
      "plan is pro,we have to update this uses limit to10,000. Okay. So, we can easily do that.That's going to be very easy. That's notany hurt thing. We just have to make it10,000 where when we're updating it. Sowe are updating we're updating here planis pro and uses limit is going to be10,000.Yeah.Cool. So 10,000 every month.Done.Yeah. We can save it.So it's going to work from now on. It'sgoing to change it to the usage limit.So we can do one more testing again. Soupgrade with stripe. Let's write hereour card number424242and sameand hit subscribe. It's processing.and done. So billing success true. Youcan see pro and our limit is right now10,000. So actually it's perfectlyworking. It's right now 10,000and this is our current plan right now.Current plan. Cool.So for the first part our this work isdone. For the second part, we'llimplement this invoices because it'salso going to be easy. But for now, Iactually don't want to make this videoto more long because it's already verylong. Let me",
      "isdone. For the second part, we'llimplement this invoices because it'salso going to be easy. But for now, Iactually don't want to make this videoto more long because it's already verylong. Let me finish this by implementingthis uh web hook for cryptomas. And it'sgoing to be actually easy becauseimplementing web hook for cryptomas isvery easy. So inside here, let's createonroute dotts. Inside here we can import somethingfrom ouruhlips.Soactually lib then kryptonous and herewe're going to actually import kryptomusclient. Yeah. Now let's create here ourpost request endpoint. Sopost export as sync function post. It'sgoing to receive request as a parameter.We're going to receive the body ourrequest body from here that requestdojson. Now we're going to check thevalidity with just this cryptoclient.ppayments dot verify web signature.That's it. We're providing here IP andrequest and cryptomas webbook verifierwill actually match it for us. If it'snot valid then we can throw an errorthat",
      "dot verify web signature.That's it. We're providing here IP andrequest and cryptomas webbook verifierwill actually match it for us. If it'snot valid then we can throw an errorthat invalid signature otherwise we willget our user data. How? If thebody status equals to paid and then wewill get our user ID. How we will getour user ID? Let me show you how.Try to understand when we are creatingthe payment. So the payment is insidethis billing cryptomus link and thisroute.ts we are passing here user ID inthis payload. So that's why right now wewill be able to get back this user IDinside this web hook right now. Okay.It's easier for us right now since wealready sent it earlier. Yeah. Now aftergetting it what we have to do we have tosearch for our user. So we can do onething. We can copy it that user data.Come back hereat first DB import from our O now fromuser. So user is same O schema. Now EQresultuh user email. So actually no user idandbody dotuserid. Yeah that's it. So this is our userdata",
      "data.Come back hereat first DB import from our O now fromuser. So user is same O schema. Now EQresultuh user email. So actually no user idandbody dotuserid. Yeah that's it. So this is our userdata right now. So now what we can[clears throat] do now we can update it.So we can copy this line. We can comeback here. We can update the userstable. The plan will be pro. Users limitwill be this where users do user ID ismatching with this user data and thisID. Yeah, that's it. Our work isactually done. We can right now returnthe response thatsuccess true status 200. That's it. Ourcrypto web hook work is done. We'rereceiving everything here and we aredoing our work and then we're returning200 to crypto so that cryptomas willunderstand yeah the web hook issuccessful. I mean when there is sendingrequest it's getting to 100. Yeah. Sowe'll be able to see that on ourdashboard. That's it. Our cryptomas webhook endpoint is also ready. How you canunderstand it? You just have to activateyour account.",
      "it's getting to 100. Yeah. Sowe'll be able to see that on ourdashboard. That's it. Our cryptomas webhook endpoint is also ready. How you canunderstand it? You just have to activateyour account. You have to like deploythe website right now. Because right nowif you pay here you will not receive theweb hook endpoint. Why? Because herecrypto doesn't work with local host. Youmust have to deploy your application onthis domain. On which domain? On thisjust a minute on thisdomain. Okay. This project URL. So ifit's in the same project URL then it'sgoing to work. Otherwise it's not youare not going to receive the web hookendpoint and the same thing also evenhappen for stripe you might be thinkinghow then stripe is doing it you can seestripe is providing on claotherwise also stripe cannot sendrequest to this local host because localhost is just inside your computer it'sjust mapping on IP behind it behind thelocal host like 192 something okay itdepends on your network so they doesn'thave your IP",
      "to this local host because localhost is just inside your computer it'sjust mapping on IP behind it behind thelocal host like 192 something okay itdepends on your network so they doesn'thave your IP address access. It's notpossible from their end to send requestto your local IP. That's why Stripeadded this web endpoint which actuallymakes sense because it's works well.Yeah. And Cryptomas as I know they'realso working on this thing and I believethey will be also available. They willbe able to make it soon as like Stripelike for sandbox mode. Yeah. So that'sit. Right now if you pay through yourwebsite your account will be updated aslike the stripe one because everythingis similar here. Yeah that's it. So forthis part I would say for the first partour project is done. For the next secondpart what we're going to do and I giveyou an recap. First of all this billingstory we will do that later. I justdon't want to make this video too morelong. Then templates we just finished ontemplates. We",

And finallywe were just testing our like templates.We were not creating any workflow. Ifyou notice in our workflow we even don'thave any workflow table yet. So we aregoing to create that workflow table andwe're going to store those inside ourworkflow table. Yeah we're going to dothat and we need inest for that. Why dowe need ingest? I'll explain that in thesecond part of this video series. Weneed ingest for so many things since weare using next.j that's why inest iskind of like on lifesaver for us. Yeah.So we need ingest. We need anapplications for storing logs. So thesecond part is also going to be crazylevel interesting because after all ofthis we're going to save everything inthe second part like",
